# Dan and Peck Comments

Glad that you like the more skeletal email structure, they're much easier to write and very seasonal.
I'm working on everything put forward now (thanks for replying over the weekend, tho sorry to have sent it then!) and just wanted to make a few replies here regarding both emails

DS:


* Will try to make the language less psych-y and lead with a more theory-relevant question and make the lead in and out of that area clearer that it's outlining the main question from the chapter as it best pertains to SMT.
* Will add the 'Transcribe' and Bayes mention earlier on. Just putting this whole chapter on paper has been reshuffle after reshuffle and think there are also a few more things I can do in the chapter that will make it less technical. It's just annoying because I really want to just write something like "This is basically just a ReadLines() function in any computer program" but know that is not a good idea. 

RP: 

* My attempt at using "works" was meant to be synonymous with "this is an explanatory not a descriptive theory" so I should just say that.
* Sorry about that ambiguous bullet point, that is where I want to have the pictures of the two melodies I discuss in the text to go. That won't be there for the next draft. 
* Again-- will swap out "works", coming back to it after 2 days it does seem like more of something said in a impromptu talk rather than formal proposal. 
* Will try to front load the significance to music theory, I have a bit more from other parts of the dissertation I can stick there which will bring me up on the word count.
