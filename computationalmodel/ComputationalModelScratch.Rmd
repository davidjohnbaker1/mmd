This document sketches out the initial ideas for the computatational model of melodic dictation.
Plan is to take this information and then transfer it over to the end of the dissertation.

## Broad Level Description

On a very high level, this model reflects the cognitive processes engaged with in order for individuals to take melodic dictation.
The model reflects decisions at each stage of the dictation process.
The model is dynamic in that before running it you need to set a few different thresholds and a set of prior knowledge.
The model works largetly in two parts that take inspirtation from the music cognition and working memory capacity literature.
Partiuclarly Karpinski 2000 and Margulis 2005.
The first part models how incoming musical information is represented in musical attention.
The second part of the model transcribes the musical information in the attention buffer using a recursive function that is compared against the piror knowledge the model.
Each attempt at transcription is tallyed and less attempts equate to easier transcription.
Additionally, in the second part of the model options are availble that mirror the short hand proto notation as described by Karpinski 2000.
By making the model an explanatory as opposed to descriptive model, it can be used to help inform pedagogy.
It also puts assumptions of melodic representation to test and provides evidence that no-AP people should always use moveable do.
Could it also address how people with AP represent and handel the process.

Technically a baysian model?  

### Model Parts

Below I list out all the moving parts of the model and how things are represented.

#### Prior Knowledge/Corpus

* Let prior be represented by a **corpus**, **M** where each melody in the corpus is represented via a string of *n-grams* of every n length of the melody. For example, if a melody has 15 notes, it should be represetned 

```{r}
melody.length <- 15

calculate.n.grams.needed <- function(x = melody.length){
  if(x == 0 ) return(x)
    else
      x - 1
}


```


#### Melodic Attention 

#### Transcription


## Verbal Model 

The prior knowledge is represented by a corpus of **n-gram** transitions in the **mint** humdrum format.

reentry 







```


## Implementation



1. Let the _Prior Knowledge_ be represented by the corpus $M$ where each melody, $m$, is symbolic string representing the all possible n-grams of the melody.
2. Calculate the information content of each $m$ using IDyOM.
3. Define $t$ as the threshold set within $M$ as the threshold which an n-gram needs to be represented to be explicitly known.
4. Let $t$ be a new target melody not represented in $M$.
5. Let $WMC$ a numeric value representing the maximum information content that can be held in _Selective Attention_.
6. Define $LISTEN$ as a function that sequentially reads the string $t$
7. Define $pitch-search$ as pattern matching search of $M$ exclusively on pitch information.
8. Define $rhythm-search$ as pattern matching search of $M$ exclusively on rhythmic information.

### Listening 

1. $LISTEN$ to $t$ and calculate the cumulative information content of $t$ until it exceeds $WMC$.
2. Define truncated string as $exract$. 
3. Move $extract$ to Selective Attention.
4. Define $Re-entry$ as function that executes $PLAY$ at pre-defined location in string (i.e. linear, low IC n-gram)


### Transcribe Function

1. Define $Transcribe$ as : search $M$ for an exact pattern match of $extract$ against n-grams where $explicit == TRUE$.
2. If match is found, $extract$ is $Notated$, execute $Re-entry$
3. If no match is found, truncate 1 token from $extract$ and perform search again. Perform this step recursively.
4. If no match is found, execute $pitch-search$ OR $rhythm search$.
5. Upon completion of $pitch-search$ OR $rhythm search$, run other search to complete information.
6. IF no patterns found with $Transcribe$ OR  $pitch-search$ OR $rhythm search$, execute $Re-entry$.

* Will represent it as a flowchart with definitions of terms and functions at top!
