# Experiments

## Rationale 
### Have done all this and have not actually talked about dictation yet 
### Clearly many factors contribte to this whole thing and need to be taken into a model 
### Dictation is basically a within subjects design Experiment
#### Get very ecological and dirty and run it 

* Paney 2016 had 30 second timing 

### Factors
#### Cognitive
##### WMC
##### GF
#### Training
##### Goldsmiths MSI 
#### Musical 
##### FANTASTIC
##### IDyOM
#### Investigate melodies with this context and set scoring 
#### Mirror design to see if effects of melody are there

## Experiments
### Experiment I
#### Participants
#### Procedure
#### Materials
#### Scoring 
#### Results
#### Modeling
#### Discussion 
### Experiment II
#### Participants (New)
#### Procedure (Same)
#### Materials (Swapped but controlled)
#### Scoring (Same)
#### Results
#### Modeling (same)
### General Discussion 
#### What happened
#### Assumption of all of this is that many things are happening linearly in combination with each other
#### Additionally the mixed effects framework works better with more data? 
#### Also how we score it is going to mess wiht the DVs
### Really what is needed is Computational Model
