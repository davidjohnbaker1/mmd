## Chapter 1

One could even go further and borrow a thought experiment from the world of neuroscience and imagine a double dissociation with melodic dictation ability and musical skill.
Thinking about one's colleagues 

Even using a simple thought experiment using the old double dissicoation thign that htey love in neuroscience where you could imagine both situations where someone was probably a very good musician, but not that great at melodic dictation, or the converse where someone might be very good at melodic dictation, but is not that good of a musician (whatever that means) would indicate that there is probably not that strong of a casusal link between dictation abilities as measured by grades in an aural skills class and the infinite possiblities of musical activities that are even possible.  



In her textbook _Practical Ear Training_ Janet McLoud McGaughy notes that

> qualified musicians must develop reading, singing, and notational skills in order to achieve acuity of aural perception and to make effective use of that acuity" (p. i)."

which makes the point that the development of ear training is about developing acuity in aural percepiton which then is then transfered over for other musical activity.

UTAH MAN QUOTE

#### Verbal model, has problems, OK for pedagogy

As a verbal model, Karpinski's model of dictation makes sense and breaks down a very complicated cognitive process into discrete, sequential steps.
This model, whether or not Karpinski intented it to be an actual cognitive model, I don't know, assumes serial processing of information and does not specify any of the actual parameters for each of the steps.
This model serves as a great stepping off point for this dissertation, and its good for me that he didn't actually specificy any of the actual parameters, he just said certain things happen and gave an approximate order of the whole thing.
He talks about a lot of the parameters leading up to it all,
Even talks about things like representation and other paramters that are going to influence it all.
Did not attempt to pin down any of the exact parameters of his model, but this is just me wanting to forshadown Chapter 6 where I take each of these issues and implement them in a computational model. 
While covering many bases, one of the problems with using a verbal model as opposed to a computational one is that by not specificying exaclty what happens when and how everything is represented, the model can manifest itself in a multiude of different ways.

Take for example the often cited model of working memory by Alan Baddely and Grahm Hitch which posits a modular view of workign memory capcacity [@baddeleyWorkingMemory1974].
As discussed in CITE, although the model only has X amount of distinctive systems, the fact that they left it to be a verbal model of memory, and did not tack down exactly how each parameter functions, when built as computational model actually ends up yielding 156 different models. 
While I will reseve discussing how many possible models might exists as derrived from the Karpinski for Chapter 6, it is suffice to say that clearly establishing the degree to which part of the model contributes in concrete way only helps with furthering the literature.

When viewed from a pedagogical stand point, espcielaly given how litle time people have, it would basically be impossible to attend to each of these things in a gradient fashion in the standard 15 week semester that people have. 
When people teach this, need to rely very much on intuition and basically adjust to the level of your class and syllabus and whatever on the fly in order to convey the most amount of musical materials possible. 

Conversly, when viewed from an experimental standpoint, each of the above mentioned processes is bascially an experimental parameter waiting to be investigated.
Additionally, the process that is put forth by KARPINSKI 1999 provides a stepping off point for positing some sort of comutational model.
Going to add substatinally to it in that going to take into account both how difficulty the melodies are, something we have intiutive understanding of, but could be operationalized, and also going to try to model individual differences based on factors that prior literature would suggest are different in individuals and should be considered in any sort of modeling going forward. 
In addition to these above parameters discussed by Karpinski, now review other factors that could then contribute to this process.

Clearly, would be worth understanding the concept at a deeper level since clealry they have done a lot of great work on the topic. 
Adoptiong chrnological take of the history of research the heavy hitters are 
* Attkinson and Shriff 
* Miller 1956 and why that is a bad idea
* Baddely and Hitch 
* Nelson Cowan + need for complex span

For reasons discussed on p 18 of cowan 2005 and page 42 , choose to adopot a Cowanian view where WMC is basically the window of attention.
Additinally it's worth noting initially that you can't directly apply these frameworks to memory for musical material because after reading page 109 in Cowan, important to note that all melodies appear in serial order. 
To make analogous task based on something like complex span tasks, would need to take certain set of notes and then always a finate setb be played back in arandom order (see chatper 3)

## Old Drafts of Chapter Structure BELOW THIS LINE 
## Theoretical Background and Rationale

As stated above, melodic dictation is a hugely complex process.


What am I going to do in this chapter?
  + Intro to aural skills and melodic dictation 
  + Talk about the factors that go into it (basically real time suduko)
    + Cognitive
    + Musical 
  + Note that reserach is messy, need to think of it polymorphically
 

Even anecdoatal evidence suggests that people who are good at this tend to stay good and people who are bad at it tend to stay bad

Other things that I might not want to bring up right now is that a lot of this could just be thought of as relating to a big thought experiemnt where you could imagine that there are many musicians from lots of different muscial cultures (bring in the ethnos!) that could imagine being sucessful at what they do without having this ability to take melodic dicatation.
Is it just a party trick? 
Also here would be a good place to jump off of and talk about the lack of transfer.

Where do people learn it? -- Music school
Part of large thing of aural skills 
Absoulte ubiquity, but for the amount that it is done, relatively understudied

   

Not only is this process intenstive, but also ubiquitous 

## 

@karpinskiAuralSkillsAcquisition2000 schematizes this ability into a four step process of hear, remember, understand, notate (See Figure 1?).

While 
Some researchers have estimated that XX amount of processes are needed to sucessfully execute this task FIND CITATION. 

-- Should be drawing here from ICMPC paper?

## Order of Chapter 1

* Hook on why this is important
* What is melodic dictation?
  + Process (reasons of why factors)
  + Who has talked about it before?
  + Why is it important -- training ear and transfer
* Most of the people who are talking about this are pedagogical, really it's perceptual 
* Here is huge list of literature of things that might contribute
  + Pedagogical factors
  + Cognitive Factors
  + Musical Factors 
  + All of these are moving parts, need better tools to describe
* While this is the narrative, does not conform to updated view of polymorphism of musicianship

## Order of Chapter 2

* Most of this literature comes from pedagogy
* All quotes about people should be able to do this
* Long history of Aural Skills 
  + Older people
  + Current Methods
  + Their goals 
  + Their assumptions 

+ People are not good at this 
  + Wennerstronm (1989) said people at IU are not good at aural skills and sight singing p.163 (k7)
  + Julliard (1953,p. 48) incoming students have untrained ear (k7)
  
+ nice quote from chittum 1967 "the da is past when teachers can say, you either have it or you don't" (p.73)
+ Start of a big Journey back then, even more now (almost 2 decades since Karpinski, 2000)

Karpinski 1990 Has its own model for melodic perception?? 

Page 66 of K -- Relevant Melodic Contour Information 
page 68 of K -- Deutsch -- Familiar systems are better (now we have IDyOM)
Dowling and Harwood 1986 124-44 Melodic expectancy (probably better for Pearce)

7-11 Notes? 
Marple ND reports that most things land in 7 +/-2, But not mention of IC! 
Found that if you make it rhythmic, goes up to 6-10, rhythm helps, but maybe it's just shorter time

Potter 1980 -- most people chunk (obvs question of segmentation)
Deutsch 1980 rhtym alines with pich, people do better than non-hierarchy 
Oura 1991 -- MODEL OF HOW MANY PITCHES PEOPLE REMEMBER, use for corpus question on pattern matching

Hofsetter 1981 -- people do better in bottom 4 time than 8 (again maybe confounded by IC)

Page 98 in Karpinksi has lenght and number of playings, 

Effect of tempo in  Unks, Bowers, and Eagle 1993

+++++++++++++++
Define the rationale and significance for this study
talk about what the processes are that go into this 
What are the implicit transfer claims of this? 
    + discussed in chapter 2 (history and rationale, Karpinski)
    + transfer literature also dicussed in chapter 2
Is there literature specifically on this? Yes, but scant.


what contributes to this whole process?

Note that there are two fields, both of which's literature can help out.

### Memory for Melodies Literature 

### WMC

### Gf 


###Outline Notes

* Melodic Dictation is clearly something that uses WM
* Also dependent on WMC
* Problem is that there is not a direct comparison
* WMC tasks, simple and complex are with novel stimuli
* Even in cases of WMC, need to control for word frequency
* This allows us to know that exposure effects this ability
* Huge amount of work on statistical exposure (Saffran, Huron, Margulis, Pearce)

* Could take theories of WMC but capacitity limits and WMC task do not medoel the sequential and hierarchical nature of melodies
* Obvious alternative to this is to look at n-grams in melodies
* Image chart where overlay of n-gram is reflected in frequency distribution of chart
* Clealry we have task where complex entertaining of information and working

* What is emlodic equivlient to the word length effect?
* Is there such a thing with decay and melodies (Lewandasky + Corey's work)
* Hard to model idea of repeating things bc of rhythm problem and temporal properties

* STOP IT WIHT THE MILLER (Articles that reference Miller but get it wrong list)

* Question of how is music represented, is there some sort of pholoogical representation (is then the point to split the intervals with each phonological rep with the episodic buffer playing a role?)
* Do students need to know what their WMC maximum is

### Cowan Reading Notes

* It's helpful to assume there are constants in psychology 
* Why prefer Cowan over Baddeley, boat example 
* Stop with the miller 7 quotes, should be listing of these
* WMC as form of attention
* History of WMC models (Process Model Attkinson, Baddely, Berz, Cowan)
* Rapid formation of new episodic buffer
* Is solfege assigment automatic? Transferred to new realm of representation
* Need to get away from idea of chunking for MMD
* Melodies are always in serial order 
* Aka from above need to look at n-gram representation
* could imagine making some sort of sensory memory experiemnt ala page 114
* More options to write down, more error on recall, clearly not free recall situation, pattern matching

- I want examples of frequency distribution confounding memory experiemnts

## Baker Model of Melodic Dictation (Over Karpinski)

* Divert attention to maximum n-gram 
  * Open n-gram/attn to LTM matching
  * When LTM match maxed, put n-gram in phological loop 
  * Transcribe all matched n-gram with LTM match ups (effecient processing? sd)
  
  - {Warning if beyond capacity limit} (tho how does this relate to LTM)
  * IF {Chunk is understandable => Transcribe}
  * IF {Chunk is not understandable --> Segment to smaller unit }
    * LTM as first option (contextualized)
    * Rhythmic and Contour framework 
      -- SD options first on contour
      -- Avoid Interval (last resort) requires LTM single interval pattern match with n-gram of loop
      -- Also avoid interval because it disgards maximum of n-gram
  * Only patterns with LTM match will be transcribed (aka do sight singing)
  * If not LTM match, then need recursive process to figure out new schema for looped n-gram
  
* Also, model that took n-gram funcitonality into the description would also account for weird atonal melodies where they have no function, but rather are built upon diatonic sequencs that are linked together with atonal gestures
      
* Theoretical reasons for stopping atomistic sight singing
  - It's only small block of more fluid and complex process
  - Could AP mapping be brought in here? 

* Span speed correlation and doing some sort of melody thing wiht an experiment 

* Eventually do POT and Music for this
