# Computation Chapter

The point of this chapter is to show you can use tools from computational musicology as predictive features of melodies in experiments. 

* Comp linguistics and information theory
* Get featuers from thigns like FANTASTIC
* How they can be used in experiemnts eventually 

Thesis: Measures from computational musicology can be helpful in pedagogical setting. First talk about background and basics before, then add in a section about perceptual fluency via statistical learning and how a corpus and computational model of auditory cognition can help serve that purpose, then if IC is a good measure, how that will lend itself to better ways of student success (and that we only got to this via a computational data drive approach)

As discussed in literature review, people have found ways to measure melodies with computers.
Can do this just with the melody itself.
Can do this with melody and other melodies in context.
And this too has been done in the music pedagogy world.

I am saying that there's alink between what is on page and perception that we can take advantage of

## Humans like patterns and are very good at picking them up
### We learn things implicitly
### We can represent that implicit knowledge with a corpus 
## Pre-Musical Corpora
### Information Theory
### Computational Linguistics as front runner
## Musical Corpora
### History of Musical Corpora 
#### Fun old computational music papers 
#### Corpora that are often used
#### Static vs Dynamic models of feature abstraction (daniel slides?)
### FANTASTIC 
#### static 
#### ML approach gets it right
#### simple to understand
#### Can abstract features be percieved? 
###### Note density
###### Contour variation
###### Tonalness
###### weird computational measures
### IDyOM as representation of musical materials 
#### n-gram models
#### mirrors human behavior
###### melody
###### harmony
## So What?
#### Other research (Chapt 3) suggest need to move beyond cognitive measures
#### Can operationalize item level items contextually with a corpus 
#### IF features are real, they should effect dictation (Chater 6)
#### Not only important for one off, but then would be incorporated into computational learning models (Chapter 6)
#### We need new materials
