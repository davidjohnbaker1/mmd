# Individual Differences

### Rationale 

The first two steps of Gary Karpinski's model of melodic dictation [@karpinskiAuralSkillsAcquisition2000; @karpinskiModelMusicPerception1990] rely exclusively on the mental representation of melodic information.
Karpinski conceptualizes the first stage of _hearing_ as solely involving the physical motions on the tympanic membrane as well as the listener's attention to the musical stimulus.
This stage is distinguished from that of _short-term melodic memory_ which refers to the amount of melodic information that can be represented in conscious awareness.
Given that neither stage of the first two steps of Karpinski's model requires any sort of musical expertise, every individual with normal hearing should be able to partake in the first two steps of the process.^[This whole model needs critique under the WMC literature. It's kind of strange to think that the act of something hitting your ear is different than attention (the way that Cowan thinks about WMC and again that you can split up the representation in memory from that of what the characteristics are of the melody like the meter and scale degrees, which have been argued to be part of intrinsic qualia) also there is a big problem here about stuff being actively rehearsed or not]
It is only with explicit education in music theory and aural skills when individuals learn musical literacy do people develop the ability to start to link what is heard to what can then be understood and then notated.
Additionally, with more musical training, individuals also increase in their ability to perform musical tasks CITES.
Though attempting to investigate all parts of this process from hearing to short-term melodic memory to musical understanding to notation is not only cumbersome from a theoretical perspective, but parsing out what happens at each stage in a dictator's mind is unfeasible practically due to the amount of variables at play.
In order to get a clearer picture of what mechanisms are involved in this process, the steps must be be investigated in turn.
This chapter investigates the first two steps of the Karpinski model by investigating individual factors that contribute to how someone learns a melody that do not depend on their knowledge of Western musical notation.
By understanding which, if any, individual factors play a role in this process, it will inform what can be reasonably expected of individuals when other musical variables are introduced.

## Individual Differences

As stated above, the first two steps of Karpinski's model of melodic dictation are not exclusive to trained musicians.
The first two steps involve both the hearing of the melody and the retention of the melody in conscious awareness.
Presumably individuals differ in their ability at this level to listen to and memorize musical materials.
And presumably an individual's ability to perform well on this task could be attributed to a number of factors.
One of the first, and perhaps most obvious factors would be an individual's musical training.
-- Musicial training information
While the literatre above provides a body of evidence to suggest that musically trained individuals will outperform their non-musical counterparts, musical training is not and cannot be the sole determining factor in how well an individual remembers a melody.
Presumably people differ in their ability to retain information and there might even be people without musical training who, just due to their innate abilities, are able to outperform people with musical training based on their cognitive ability.



These are the first steps as well in any melodic dictation task.
this is cognitive ability, defined as XXXX to do task
But in addition to congitive ability, reason to believe that musical training will also affect this

So in order to get a better idea of melodic dictation, need to look at how most people do when having to do short term melody memory and eventually manipulate it.
In order to do this, need to look at variables that might be at play.

### Musical Training

Tacit assumption in pedagogy that people are going to start out about hte same.
Karpinski limits the amount of melodic information that can enter _short-term melodic memory_ "somewhere between five and nine notes", citing Miller [@millerMagicalNumberSeven1956] then supports 
Then the ideas is that with training...
Via the process of Extractive Listening and Chunking are individuals then further able to "extend the capacity of short-term melodic memory"
Viable theory specifically for melodic dictation on descriptive level.

This is also backed up with a host of literature showing htat musicians tend to outperform
Especially when the task in musical 
-- look at these examples here

May of these studies could be read in such a way where its the effect of training, especially in musical thing.

though there are problems

first is lack of how musicianship is measured.

- Not only that, but field suffers from non-standard way to measure musicality
- and question of what is your dependant varaible of what is being measured
- relationshp exists, but depends how you conceptulize it.
- One way to get aroudn musicality problem is Gold-MSI
- points on gold msi 
- gives us standard measure of musicality, ontological problem
- also gives standard set of objective measrues
- people establish that there is something here.
- but one problem is that maybe that there more domain general processes accounting for this
- one way that other people have looked at it os OS
- They think about it as LV with three separate sets they define as xyz
- thing is, this is very close to WM (what they call separate)


second is causality is probably reversed
But one thing that we have to keep in mind is that the direction of causality could actually be reversed.
There is not enough experimentl data to suggest it.
-- mixed experimental data here
-- also lack of good covariates


And the rest of what we have is cross sectional and correlational 
Really ways to understand it come from OS 
they say three main things

Thing that makes the mnost sense is probably what GS says that it exacerbates pre-existing differences.

but note a lot of this is general fluid intelligence, not WM! 

So if this is the case, we need to look into other factors that might then also play a role

OS looked at this a bit ago with the Gold-MSI and the idea of executive functioning
-- paper summary here

Here they break up EF into a few different categories,
-- note here the parallels on WM and melodic dictation

Important to highlight these sets of differences because tasks related to XYZ are very close to what you use on MD.
In fact, this parallel is not even that new 

Looking at working memory we are not the first to point this out.
Berz did it here and noted that could just be wmc.
Berz contiues in vain of Baddely and Hitch
They solve the problem with having loops.
Berz continues in this tradiition by setting up another loop for music
But this is a problem for a few reasons.

if you define it as complex, need to be doing complex


For those reasons, decide instead to adopt the Embedded Process Model by Cowan.
It works like this.
And will eventually be more suited for what we are trying to do.
Also mention here the problem with Karpinski model that it doesnt say waht is actively rehearsed.

So the task now is now to investrigate how all of these factors come together.
First is to get a task that uses the first two steps of the Karpinski model that is accesible to the non-musically trained.
Then idea is to parse out the data to see which of the variables contributes to this task.

### Dictation without Dictation

Gold-MSI why here

### Cognitive Measures of interest

* WMC but do it with complex span tasks
* take two measures of ravens for good measure
* then also make sure to have a bevy of covariates so that we are not confounded 

### PATH Analysis here

Path and SEM why here
Why not regression
And how this has been used to determine causal mechaisms, but that was done in a closed system.
Still, relies on algerbric relationships and intense theory which we have.


### Hypotheses here 

Given the data generated from the Gold-MSI with melodic memory
And also we have the stuff with SEM, plan to build a series of SEMs to see what investigates.
Follow in steps of where this has been done before EE paper.
And then from here we will have an idea of what should be considered in future analyses. 

### Methods Lead in 

Given a robust instrument for measuring musciality, and two well established cognive measrues as specifically defined, this study analysis seeks to investigate the degree to which these individual level variables are predictive of a task that is proxy to AS.

If much of musical memory has to do with Training, GMSI related variables should be most predictive.
If instead cognitive factors do play a role, should see that in path loadings.
Things could additionally interact and could do more complicated analyses with music level.

## Overview of Experiment (cross sectional design)

### Participants

Two hundred fifty-four students enrolled at Louisiana State University completed the study. 
We recruited students, mainly in the Department of Psychology and the School of Music.
The criteria for inclusion in the analysis were no self-reported hearing loss, not actively taking medication that would alter cognitive performance, and univariate outliers (defined as individuals whose performance on any task was greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean score of that task). 
Using these criteria, eight participants were not eligible due to self reporting hearing loss, one participant was removed for age, and six participants were eliminated as univariate outliers due to performance on one or more of the tasks of working memory capacity.
Thus, 239 participants met the criteria for inclusion. The eligible participants were between the ages of 17 and 43 (M = 19.72, SD = 2.74; 148 females). 
Participants volunteered, received course credit, or were paid $20.

### Materials

Cognitive Measures

All variables used for modeling approximated normal distributions. 
Processing errors for each task were positively skewed for the complex span tasks similar to Unsworth, Redick, Heitz, Broadway, and Engle (2009). 
Positive and significant correlations were found between recall scores on the three tasks measuring working memory capacity (WMC) and the two measuring general fluid intelligence (Gf). 
The WMC recall scores negatively correlated with the reported number of errors in each task, suggesting that rehearsal processes were effectively limited by the processing tasks (Unsworth et al., 2009).

#### Measures

##### Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index Self Report (Gold-MSI)

Participants completed a 38-item self-report inventory and questions consisted of free response answers or choosing a
selection on a likert scale that ranged from 1-7. (Müllensiefen, et al., 2014). 
The complete survey with all questions used can be found at goo.gl/dqtSaB.

##### Tone Span (TSPAN)

Participants completed a two-step math operation and then tried to remember three different tones in an alternating sequence (based upon Unsworth et al., 2005). 
We modelled the three tones after Li, Cowan, Saults (2005) paper using frequencies outside of the equal tempered system (200Hz, 375Hz, 702Hz). 
The same math operation procedure as OSPAN was used. The tones was presented aurally for 1000ms after each math operation. During tone recall, participants were presented three different options H M and L (High, Medium, and Low), each with its own check box.
Tones were recalled in serial order by clicking on each tone’s box in the appropriate order.
Tone recall was untimed.
Participants were provided practice trials and similar to OSPAN, the test procedure included three trials of each list length (3-7 tones), totalling 75 letters and 75 math operations.

##### Operation Span (OSPAN)

Participants completed a two-step math operation and then tried to remember a letter (F, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, R, S, T, or
Y) in an alternating sequence (Unsworth et al., 2005). 
The same math operation procedure as TSPAN was used. 
The letter was presented visually for 1000ms after each math
operation. 
During letter recall, participants saw a 4 x 3 matrix of all possible letters, each with its own check box. 
Letters were recalled in serial order by clicking on each letter’s box in the appropriate order. 
Letter recall was untimed. 
Participants were provided practice trials and similar to TSPAN, the test procedure included three trials of each list length (3-7 letters), totalling 75 letters and 75 math operations.

##### Symmetry Span (SSPAN)

Participants completed a two-step symmetry judgment and were prompted to recall a visually-presented red square on a 4 X 4 matrix (Unsworth et al., 2005). 
In the symmetry judgment, participants were shown an 8 x 8 matrix with random squares filled in black. 
Participants had to decide if the black squares were symmetrical about the matrix’s vertical axis and then click the screen. 
Next, they were shown a “yes” and “no” box and clicked on the appropriate box. 
Participants then saw a 4 X 4 matrix for 650 ms with one red square after each symmetry judgment. 
During square recall, participants recalled the location of each red square by clicking on the appropriate cell in serial order. 
Participants were provided practice trials to become familiar with the procedure. 
The test procedure included three trials of each list length (2-5 red squares), totalling 42 squares and 42 symmetry judgments.

##### Gold-MSI Beat Perception

Participants were presented 18 excerpts of instrumental music from rock, jazz, and classical genres (Müllensiefen et
al., 2014). 
Each excerpt was presented for 10 to 16s through headphones and had a tempo ranging from 86 to 165 beats per
minute. 
A metronomic beep was played over each excerpt either on or off the beat. 
Half of the excerpts had a beep on the beat, and the other half had a beep off the beat. 
After each excerpt was played, participants answered if the metronomic beep was on or off the beat and provided their confidence: “I
am sure”, “I am somewhat sure”, or “I am guessing”. 
The final score was the proportion of correct responses on the beat judgment.

##### Gold-MSI Melodic Memory Test

Participants were presented melodies between 10 to 17 notes long through headphones (Müllensiefen et al., 2014).
There were 12 trials, half with the same melody and half with different melodies. 
During each trial, two versions of a melody were presented. 
The second version was transposed to a different key. 
In half of the second version melodies, a note was changed a step up or down from its original position in the structure of the melody. 
After each trial, participants answered if the two melodies had identical pitch interval structures.

##### Number Series

Participants were presented with a series of numbers with
an underlying pattern. 
After being given two example problems to solve, participants had 4.5 minutes in order to solve 15 different problems. 
Each trial had 5 different options as possible answers (Thurstone, 1938).

##### Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices

Participants were presented a 3 x 3 matrix of geometric patterns with one pattern missing (Raven et al., 1998). 
Up to eight pattern choices were given at the bottom of the screen. 
Participants had to click the choice that correctly fit the pattern above. 
There were three blocks of 12 problems, totalling 36 problems. 
The items increased in difficulty across each block. 
A maximum of 5 min was allotted for each block, totalling 15 min. 
The final score was the total number of correct responses across the three blocks.

### Procedure

Participants in this experiment completed eight different tasks, lasting about 90 minutes in duration. 
The tasks consisted of the Gold-MSI self-report inventory, coupled with the Short Test of Musical Preferences, and a supplementary demographic questionnaire that included questions about socioeconomic status, aural skills history, hearing loss, and any medication that might affect their ability to perform on cognitive tests. 
Following the survey they completed three WMC tasks: a novel Tonal Span, Symmetry span, and Operation span task; a battery of perceptual tests from the Gold-MSI (Melodic Memory, Beat Perception, Sound Similarity) and two tests of general fluid intelligence (Gf): Number Series and Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices.

Each task was administered in the order listed above on a desktop computer. 
Sounds were presented at a comfortable listening level for the tasks that required headphones. 
All participants provided informed consent and were debriefed.
Only measures used in modeling are reported below.

### Results

#### Descriptive, Data Screening, Correlational

The goal of the analyses was to examine the relationships among the measures and constructs of WMC, general fluid intelligence, musical sophistication (operationalized as the General score from the Gold-MSI), in relation to the two objective listening tests on the Gold-MSI. 
Before running any sort of modeling, we inspected our data to ensure in addition to outlier issues as mentioned above, the data exhibited normal distributions. 
We report both our correlation values, as well as visually displaying our distributions in Figure 1.

Before running any modeling, we checked our data for assumptions of normality since violations of normality can strongly affect the covariances between items. 
While some items in Figure 1 displayed a negative skew, many of the individual level items from the self report scale exhibited high
levels of Skew and Kurtosis beyond the generally accepted ± 2 (Field, Miles, & Field, 2012), but none of the items with the unsatisfactory measures are used in the general factor.

#### Modeling

##### Measurement Model

We then fit a measurement model to examine the underlying structure of the variables of interest used to assess the latent constructs (general musical sophistication, WMC, general fluid intelligence) by performing a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2013) using R (R Core Team, 2017). 
Model fits in can be found in Table 3. 
For each model, latent factors were constrained to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1 in order to allow the latent covariances to be interpreted as correlations. 
Since the objective measures were on different scales, all variables were converted to z scores before running any modeling.

* MODEL HERE 

Variables are defined as follows: gen: general factor latent variable; wmc: working memory capacity; gf: general fluid intelligence; zIS: “Identify What is Special”; zHO: “Hear Once Sing Back”; zSB: “Sing Back After 2-3”; zDS: “Don’t Sing In Public”; zSH: “Sing In Harmony”; zJI:”Join In”; zNI: “Number of Instrumetns”; zRP:”Regular Practice”; zNCS: “Not Consider Self Musician”; zNcV: “Never Complimented”; zST: “Self Tonal”; zCP: “Compare Performances”; zAd: “Addiction”; zSI: “Search Internet”; zWr: “Writing About Music”; zFr: “Free Time”; zTP: “Tone Span”; zMS: “Symmetry Span”; zMO: “Operation Span”; zRA: “Ravens”; zAN: “Number Series”.

#### Structural Equation Models

Following the initial measurement model, we then fit a series of SEMs in order to investigate both the degree to which factor loadings changed when variables were removed from the model as well as the model fits. 
We began with a model incorporating our three latent variables (general musical sophistication, WMC, general fluid intelligence) predicting our two objective measures (beat perception and melodic memory scores) and then detailed steps we took in order to improve model fit. 
For each model, we calculated four model fits: χ2 , comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error (RMSEA), and Tucker Lewis Index (TLI). 
In general, a non-significant χ2 indicates good model fit, but is overly sensitive to sample size. 
Comparative Fit Index (CFI) values of .95 or higher are considered to be indicative of good model fits as well as Root Mean Square Error (RMSEA) values of .06 or lower, Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) values closer to 1 indicate a better fit. (Beajean, 2014).

After running the first model (Model 1), we then examined the residuals between the correlation matrix the model expects and our actual correlation matrix looking for residuals
above .1. 
While some variables scored near .1, two items dealing with being able to sing (“I can hear a melody once and sing it back after hearing it 2 – 3 times” and “I can hear a melody once and sing it back”) exhibited a high level of correlation amongst the residuals (.41) and were removed for  Model 2 and model fit improved significantly (χ2 (41)=123.39,
p < . 001). 

After removing the poorly fitting items, we then proceeded to examine if removing the general musical sophistication self-report measures would significantly improve model fit for Model 3. 
Fit measures for Model 3 can be seen in Table 3 and removing the self-report items resulted in a significantly better model fit (χ2 (171)=438.8, p < . 001). 
Following the rule of thumb that at least 3 variables should be used to define any latent-variable (Beajuean, 2014) we modelled WMC as latent variable and Gf as a composite average of the two tasks administered in order to improve model fit. 
This model resulted in significant improvement to the model (χ2 (4)=14.37, p < . 001). 
Finally we examined the change in test statistics between Model 2 and a model that removed the cognitive measures-- a model akin to one of the original models reported in Müllensiefen et al., (2014)-- for Model 5. 
Testing between the two models resulted in a significant improvement in model fit (χ2 (78)=104.75, p < . 001). 
Figure 3 displays Model 4, our nested model with the best fit indices.

### Discussion

##### Measurement Model 

After running a confirmatory factor analysis on the variables of interest, the model fit was below the threshold of what is considered a “good model fit” as shown in Table 1 with references to above model fits. 
This finding is to be expected since no clear theoretical model has been put forward that would suggest that the general musical sophistication score, when modelled with two cognitive measures should have a good model fit. 
This model was run to create a baseline measurement.

##### Structural Equation Model Fitting

Following a series of nested model fits, we were able to improve model fits on a series of SEMs that incorporated both measures of WMC and measures of general fluid intelligence.
Before commenting on new models, it is worth noting that the Model 5 does not seem to align with the findings from the original 2014 paper by Müllensiefen et al. 
While the correlation between the objective tasks is the same (r = .16), the factor loadings from this paper suggest lower values for both Beat Perception (.37 original, .27 this paper) as well as Melodic Memory (.28 original, .18 this paper). 
Note that two items were removed dealing with melody for memory for this model; when those items were re-run with the data, the factor
loadings did not deviate from these numbers.

The first two models we ran resulted in minor improvements to model fit. 
While difference in models was significant (χ2 (41)=123.39, p < . 001 ), probably due to the
number of parameters that were now not constrained, the
relative fit indices of the models did not change drastically. 
It was not until the self-report measures were removed from the model, and then manipulated according to latent variable modeling recommendations, was there a marked increase in the relative fit indices. 
Fitting the model with only the cognitive measures, we were able to enter the bounds of acceptable relative fit indices that were noted above. 
In order to find evidence that the cognitive models (Models 3 and 4) were indeed a better fit than using the General factor, we additionally ran a comparison between our adjusted measurement model and a model with only the self report.
While both of our nested models were significantly different, the cognitive models exhibited superior relative fit indices.
Lastly, turning to Figure 3, we note that our latent variable of WMC exhibited much larger factor loadings predicting the two objective, perceptual tests than our measure of general fluid intelligence. 
We also note that the factor loading predicting the Beat Perception task (.36) was higher than that of the Melodic Memory task (.21). These rankings mirror that of the original Müllensiefen et al., (2014) paper and merit further examination in order to disentangle what processes are contributing to both tasks.

These results align with predictions made with Process Overlap Theory (Kovacs & Conway,
2016), which predict that higher executive loads are needed
for tasks of perception. 
While we failed to predict which task would load higher --we assumed that the ability to maintain and manipulate information in the Melodic Memory task would be better predicted by WMC than the Beat Perception task-- this might be due to the fact that performing well in a melodic memory task demands a certain amount of musical training that is not captured by either cognitive measure.
In the future, we are interested in exploring more theoretically-driven models that use specific, task oriented predictors in order to explain the relationships between the perceptual tasks and the cognitive measures. 
Given the results here that suggest that measures of cognitive ability play a significant role in tasks of musical perception, we suggest that future research should consider taking measures of cognitive ability into account, so that other variables of interest are able to be shown to contribute above and beyond baseline cognitive measures.

In this paper we fit a series of structural equation models in order to investigate the degree to which baseline cognitive ability was able to predict performance on a musical perception task. 
Our findings suggest that measures of WMC are able to account for a large amount of variance beyond that of self report in tasks of musical perception.
