\chapter{Significance of the Study}\label{significance-of-the-study}}

All students pursing a Bachelor's degree in Music from universities
accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music must learn to
take melodic dictation \citep[ Section
VIII.6.B.2.A]{NationalAssociationSchools2018}. Melodic dictation is a
cognitively demanding process that requires students to listen to a
melody, retain it in memory, and then use their knowledge of Western
musical notation in order to recreate the mental image of the melody on
paper in a limited time frame. As of 2018 there are 647 Schools of Music
belonging to National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) CITE
WEBSITE, meaning that hundereds of students every year will be expected
to learn this challenging task as part of their Aural Skills education.
The logic being that as one improves in their abiliy to take melodic
dictation, this practice of critical and active listening develops as a
means to improve one's ability to ``think in music'' and thus become a
more compotent musician. While learning Aural Skills has been a hallmark
of being educated within the Western conservatory tradition, the
rationale behind both the how and why of aural skills is often thought
of as being esoteric. Throughout the past century, people have disagreed
on exactly how one does go about learning a melody with different areas
of research each attacking the problem from a different angle.

Despite its ubiqiquity in curricula within School of Music settings,
research on topics pertain to how aural skills are acquired is limited
at best. {[}Citations here about the cosntant calls butler, klondoski,
pembrook{]} The fields of music theory and cognitive psychology are best
positioned to make progress on this question, but often the skills
required to be well versed ein ither of these subjects are disparate,
published in other journals, and the research with overlap is scarce.
This problem is not new and there have been repeated attempts to bridge
the gap between practioners of aural skills and people in cognitive
psycholgy CITES. Literature from music theory has establisehd conceptual
frameworks regarding aural skills
\citet{karpinskiAuralSkillsAcquisition2000} and the relavint cognitive
psychology literature has explored factors that might contribute to
melodic perception (SCHMUKLER SYNERR 2016 2016), and there exists
applied literature from the world of music education (CITES).

However, despite these siloed areas of research, we as music researchers
do not have an a concrete understanding of exaclty what contributes to
HOW individuals learn melodies (HALPERNBARLETT2010). This is peculiar
since ``how does one learn a melody'' seems to be one of the fundamental
questions to the fields of music theory, music psychology, as well as
music education. Given this lack of understanding, it becomes even more
peculiar that this lack of convergence of evidence is then unable to
provide a solid baseline as to what student in their aural skills
classrooms can be expected to do. (Also something about we should really
know this if we are going to grade people on this ability). While no
single dissertation can solve any problem completely, this dissertation
aims to fill the gap in the literature between aural skills
practitioners (theorists and educators) and music psychologists in order
to reach conclusion that can be applied systematically in pedagogical
contexts. In order to do this I draw both literatures (music and
science) in order to demonstrate how tools from both cognitive
psychology as well as computational musicology can help move both fields
forward. Some line here about if we really want to understand what is
happening we need to know about causal factors going on here and have
experimental manipulation and things like making models of the whole
thing or talk about what Judea Pearl thinks about the ability to do some
sort of causal modeling with diagrams. Great to rely on some sort of
anecdoatal evidence, but if we are going to put things on the line with
our education then we need to be able to make some sort of falsifiable
claims about what we are doing. Can only do that through the lens of
science.

\section{Chapter Overview}\label{chapter-overview}}

In this first chapter, I introduce the process of melodic dictation and
discuss factors that would presumably could play a role in taking
melodic dictation. The chapter introduces both a theoretical backgorund
and rationale for using method form both computational musicology and
congitive psychology in order ot answr quesitona bout how individuals
learn melodies. I argue that tools for understanding this best because
as we currently understand it, I see us operating in a Kuhnian normal
science where much can be learned by just using the tools in front of
us. This chapter will clearly outline the factors hypothesized to
contribute to an individual's abilit to learn melodies, incorporating
both individual and musical parameters. The chapter ends with a
discussion some of the philosophical/theoretical problems with
attempting to measure thigns like this (is it just a party trick?) and
establishes that I will be taking a more polymorphic view of
musicianship in order to answer this question.

The second chapter of my dissertation focuses on the history and current
state of aural skills pedagogy.

Tracing back its origins to the practical need to teach musical skills
back with Guido d'Arezzo, I compare and contrast the different
methodological approaches that have been used, along with their goals.

The third chapter discusses previous work that examines individual
factors thought to contribute to one's ability to perform an aural
skills task, and it will discuss results from an experiment contributing
to a discussion of how individual differences could contribute to how a
person learns melodies.

Turning away from individual differences and focusing on musical
features, in the fourth chapter I plan to discuss how music researchers
can use tools from computational musicology as predictive features of
melodies. Inspired by work from computational linguistics and
information theory, recent work in computational musicology has
developed software capable of abstracting features thought to be
important to learning melodies, such as note density and `tonalness'
(Müllensiefen, 2009). Talk a bit about how this has been also looked at
before in the music education community.

While these features have been used in large scale, exploratory studies,
work in this chapter will discuss how these features could be used in
controlled, experimental studies as a stand-in for the intuition many
music pedagogues have when determining difficulty of a melody in a
classroom setting.

In my fifth chapter, I introduce a novel corpus of over 600 digitized
melodies encoded in a queryable format. This dataset will also serve as
a valuable resource for future researchers in music, psychology, and the
digital humanities. This chapter begins with a discussion of the history
of corpus studies, noting their origin outside of music, their current
state in music, and their limitations. This chapter, encapsulating the
encoding process, the sampling criteria, and the situation of corpus
methodologies within the broader research area, will go over summary
data and also talk about how it could be used to generate hypotheses for
future experiemnts (n-gram stuff based on patterns) .

Lastly, in the final chapter, I will synthesize the previous research in
a series of melodic dictation experiments. Stimuli for the experiments
are selected based on the abstracted features of the melodies and are
manipulated as independent variables based on the previous theoretical
literature. I then model responses from the experiments using both
individual factors and musical features in order to predict how well an
individual performs in behavioral tasks similar to some of my previously
published research (Baker \& Müllensiefen, 2017). Here I also note
important caveats in scoring melodic dictation, referencing some other
of my own work on using metrics, such as edit distance (Baker \&
Shanahan, 2018), to discuss similarities between the correct answer and
an individual's attempts at dictation. Results from the final chapter
will be discussed with reference to how findings are applicable to
pedagoges in aural skills settings. Recommendations will be made
building on current conceptual frameworks (Karpinski, 2000).

\hypertarget{what-is-melodic-dictation-and-why}{%
\section{What is melodic dictation? and
Why?}\label{what-is-melodic-dictation-and-why}}

Melodic dictation is the process in which an individual is able to hear
a melody, retain it in memory, and then use their knowledge of Western
musical notation to recreate the mental image of the melody on paper in
a limited time frame. For many, becoming profiecent at this task is at
the core of developing one's aural skills. Presumably the reason that
melodic dictation is so highly valued in music pedagogical circles is
because that time spent learning to do this highly complex set of mental
gymnastics results in increases in near transfer abilities\footnote{since
  at no point after being in an Aural Skills setting would some one
  require one to write down a melody on paper within a limited time
  frame.} that are of great benefit to the student once they leave the
classroom. Melodic dictation is only one of many skills that are taught
and assesed in Schools of Music and this skill is normally taught in the
context of an Aural Skills class. On a poetic level, the idea of aural
skills class is to be able to make one's ear better, and this is kind of
rationale has existed in music circles for at least the past 150 years.

In his highly influenctial book \emph{Aural Skills Acquisition: The
Development of Listening, Reading, and Performing Skills in
College-Level Musicians}, Gary
\citet{karpinskiAuralSkillsAcquisition2000} documents this deeply held
belief in music pedagogy circles by listing poetic adages from romantic
composer Robert Schumann in the mid 19th century through music educator
Charles Elliott in the opening of his text, thus providing concrete
examples of this belief that perfecting one's aural skills, or
\emph{ear}, more colloquially, is a highly sought after advanced skill.
After documenting many of of these, he asserts that the goal of
improving one's ear is to escape from thinking about music to thinking
in music.

A lot of the reasons that I think we do this are introspective and
anecdotal, but the thing is this is ubiquitous. There, as this
literature review will show, is not a lot of great emperical evidence
looking directly at melodic dictation, so then to claim that there are
huge transfers to be gained from learning how to do it would be
underwhelming. More recently people have noted that the rationale for
why we teach this probably deserves more critique with researchers like
Klonoski raising important questions like ``What specific deficiency is
revelaned with an incorrect reponse in melodic dictaiton settings?''
\citep{klonoskiImprovingDictationAuralSkills2006} and even earlier
researchers like Potter being baffled by the fact that many musicians do
no actually keep up with their melodic dictation abilities after the
classs ends POTTER QUOTE. Even a simple thought experiment using the old
double dissicoation thign that htey love in neuroscience where you could
imagine both situations where someone was probably a very good musician,
but not that great at melodic dictation, or the converse where someone
might be very good at melodic dictation, but is not that good of a
musician (whatever that means) would indicate that there is probably not
that strong of a casusal link between dictation abilities as measured by
grades in an aural skills class and the infinite possiblities of musical
activities that are even possible.

This is a pretty grim introduction, but want to leave no dark elephant
in the closet. Rationale for learning to do this is often tacit and
assumed and passed down over time, and despite the above is still good.
All that said, there have been people who have tried to put the argument
for melodic dictation into more concerete terms. In her textbook
\emph{Practical Ear Training} Janet McLoud McGaughy notes that

\begin{quote}
qualified musicians must develop reading, singing, and notational skills
in order to achieve acuity of aural perception and to make effective use
of that acuity" (p.~i)."
\end{quote}

which makes the point that the development of ear training is about
developing acuity in aural percepiton which then is then transfered over
for other musical activity.

UTAH MAN SAYS IT BEST WHEN HE SAYS

UTAH MAN QUOTE

Stuff about the truly aural skills.

At a deeper level, when we are teaching aural skills, we are teaching
people to be better listeners and given all of the possible things that
we can look at with aural skills, melodic dictaiton is great because
there is a lot of great literature from the world of music perception,
less to worry about than harmonic dictation, and is ubiquitous probably
because NASM requires people to have to learn how to do this to get a
music degree from an accredited music school.

Karpinski devotes an entire chapter to melodic dictation in his book,
note that it's a focal point, addressed in the majority of aural skills
textbooks, and because of this it starts out with a really good jumping
off point because he has done a lot of the preliminary work./

OK GOOD NOW I HAVE AT LEAST RATIONALIZED WHY

In addition to his bifurcation of arual skills into Listening and
Reading/Performing skills, Karpinski devotes an entire chapter to the
study of melodic dictation, providing a verbal model for how he
describes the component parts and process as a whole.

Karpinski's chapter on Aural Skills culminates in a flowchart, Figure
3.1 in his textbook reporduced below, that schematizes how he believes
the process to work.

Upon listenign to a melody,

\subsection{Karpinski schematic of it (as verbal model,
problems)}\label{karpinski-schematic-of-it-as-verbal-model-problems}}

Karpinski's schmatization of melodic dictation can generally be
conceptualized as process that consists of the following four steps:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Hear
\item
  Remember
\item
  Understand
\item
  Notate
\end{itemize}

For Karpinski, most of the cognitive action happens in the understand
process, which is the only subprocess that he groups into two differnt
sub-processes: one foo understanding the temporal aspects of music
(e.g.~pulse, meter, rhythmic proportions) and another for understand the
pitch parameters (e.g.~tonci, scale degree of starting pitch, scale
degree of subsequnt pitches). The process is looped over with every
hearing, and Karpinski suggests that the listener will use some sort of
chunking of melodies in order to hear the melody and to then notate it.

\hypertarget{verbal-model-has-problems-ok-for-pedagogy}{%
\subsubsection{Verbal model, has problems, OK for
pedagogy}\label{verbal-model-has-problems-ok-for-pedagogy}}

As a verbal model, Karpinski's model of dictation makes sense and breaks
down a very complicated cognitive process into discrete, sequential
steps. This model, whether or not Karpinski intented it to be an actual
cognitive model, I don't know, assumes serial processing of information
and does not specify any of the actual parameters for each of the steps.
This model serves as a great stepping off point for this dissertation,
and its good for me that he didn't actually specificy any of the actual
parameters, he just said certain things happen and gave an approximate
order of the whole thing. He talks about a lot of the parameters leading
up to it all, Even talks about things like representation and other
paramters that are going to influence it all. Did not attempt to pin
down any of the exact parameters of his model, but this is just me
wanting to forshadown Chapter 6 where I take each of these issues and
implement them in a computational model. While covering many bases, one
of the problems with using a verbal model as opposed to a computational
one is that by not specificying exaclty what happens when and how
everything is represented, the model can manifest itself in a multiude
of different ways.

Take for example the often cited model of working memory by Alan Baddely
and Grahm Hitch which posits a modular view of workign memory capcacity
\citep{baddeleyWorkingMemory1974}. As discussed in CITE, although the
model only has X amount of distinctive systems, the fact that they left
it to be a verbal model of memory, and did not tack down exactly how
each parameter functions, when built as computational model actually
ends up yielding 156 different models. While I will reseve discussing
how many possible models might exists as derrived from the Karpinski for
Chapter 6, it is suffice to say that clearly establishing the degree to
which part of the model contributes in concrete way only helps with
furthering the literature.

\hypertarget{verbal-model-no-individual-differnces-tho-literture-to-suggest}{%
\subsubsection{Verbal model, no individual differnces tho literture to
suggest}\label{verbal-model-no-individual-differnces-tho-literture-to-suggest}}

One thing that is lacking in the Karpinski model are any sort of
individual differences. A wealth of literature from music perception and
cognition suggests that musical training has effects on how people
perform in musical tasks TRAIN OF CITATIONS HERE. Given the evidence
that individual differences play a role here, there should be some sort
of way of incorporating them into a model of melodic dictation.

\hypertarget{computational-model-to-be-introduced}{%
\subsubsection{Computational model to be
introduced}\label{computational-model-to-be-introduced}}

From an empirical standpoint, both the task as well as the process of
melodic dictation as depicted by Karpinksi resemble something that can
be turned into an experiment, as well as a computational model. This
dissertation seeks to explore the degree to which methodologies from
cognitive psychology and computational musicology are able to further
this literature and take the next logical step in terms of understanding
aural skills.

\subsection{Clearly this is psychological problem with different item

When viewed from a pedagogical stand point, espcielaly given how litle
time people have, it would basically be impossible to attend to each of
these things in a gradient fashion in the standard 15 week semester that
people have. When people teach this, need to rely very much on intuition
and basically adjust to the level of your class and syllabus and
whatever on the fly in order to convey the most amount of musical
materials possible.

Conversly, when viewed from an experimental standpoint, each of the
above mentioned processes is bascially an experimental parameter waiting
to be investigated. Additionally, the process that is put forth by
KARPINSKI 1999 provides a stepping off point for positing some sort of
comutational model. Going to add substatinally to it in that going to
take into account both how difficulty the melodies are, something we
have intiutive understanding of, but could be operationalized, and also
going to try to model individual differences based on factors that prior
literature would suggest are different in individuals and should be
considered in any sort of modeling going forward. In addition to these
above parameters discussed by Karpinski, now review other factors that
could then contribute to this process.

\hypertarget{individual-factors-to-contribute}{%
\subsubsection{Individual Factors to
contribute}\label{individual-factors-to-contribute}}

From an individual stand point, can bifurcate factors broadly into
\emph{cognitive factors}, or factors of people that are relatively
consistent over people or basically like fixed effects things (use
definiton of what is a fixed effect); and the other side of this would
be things that would have to be delt with that change with training and
exposure. Going to refer to this second set of things as
\emph{Environmental} factors. Is there a better way to talk about this
as nature vs nurture. Addiitonally need to then mention that there are
of course epigenitic factors where both of these parameters might
interact with one another. For example, might then imagine that someone
with higher cognitive abilitty, lots of training that was put forward by
their parents, as well as tons of musical training, and personality
traits that are more likely to learn more (daniels paper on that) might
be different in terms of resutls than someone with lower cognitive
abilities, no training, low SES, and a general inclination not to even
take music lessons. While obvious, what will eventually be of interest
is the degree to which each of these things contributes to the final
models. Also gives us a better idea about pedagogy and what not.

\hypertarget{musical-factors-to-contribute}{%
\subsubsection{Musical factors to
contribute}\label{musical-factors-to-contribute}}

In addition to differences at the individual level, there are also
musical level characteristics. In this category it is also worth
taxonimizing the musical characterstics into two categories as well. On
one hand we have the structural aspects of the melody itself. These are
aspects of the melody that would remain invariant when written down on a
score. Reading from left to right, would be things like range, key, time
signature, intervals, amount of notes, contour of the melody, tonal
properties, standardized note density. Then the other side would be
musical features that I am going to deem as experiemntal features of the
melody. These are aspects of the structure of hte melody that you can
then warp within the context of a melodic dictiation such as tempo,
which then refelcts note density, timbral qualities, how many times the
melody is played, the space between hearings. This is not a categorial
divide, while I put something like range as key of the melody as
structural, you could imagine that you could have hte same interval
invariant structure of a melody , perhaps Twinkle, Twinkle little star
begginging on C2 noteated in bass cleff, but then imagine the the same
``melody'' being played two and a half octaves up on F\#4, and
transposed to minor and played quicker leading ot a phenomenologically
similar experience, but not the same. I taxonimze them early on, but
again note that a model of this should be able withstand the multitude
of patterns that exist.

Given all of these factors that then go into the melodic dictaiton
process, the remainder of this chapter will detail previous reserach
that has gone into each of these factors. Talking about each one will
provide rationale for why it should be further investigated if we are to
better understand melodic dictation. Beginning with \emph{cognitive
factors} two levels, then go on to talk about \emph{musical features}.
After discussing both and their two subcompoents as I have taxonimzed
them, offer a brief discussion on how it's bad to think about these as
just latent abilities. Instead talk about thinking about modeling
melodic dictaiton, in terms of ACTUAL MODELING, as polymorphic
conceptualization of aural skills. This is important because how we talk
about and model things reflects or values and often it will get in the
way of stuff.

\subsection{Cognitive}\label{cognitive}}

Research from the cognitive psychology literature suggests that
individuals differ in their percetual and cognitive abilities in ways
that are not easily influenced by short term-training (cite) and that
these abilities, when investigated on a large scale are predictive of a
wealth of human behavior from RICHIE CITATIONS. If literature exists
that suggests that cognitive abilites are sucessful predictors of things
related to something like academic achievement, it worth investigating
the extent that these abilities might play when modeling melodic
dictation. This is also important to understand because if we were to
find out that something as simple as general fluid intelligence was a
strong predictor in musical tasks that we are grading people on, it
would be pretty unfair to do since we are then basiclly grading people
on genetic factors beyond their control, as well as environmental
factors shown to have some sort of effect on IQ (Richie paper again).
Recenlty there has been a surge of interest in this area (nancy rogers,
LVH, utah guy, karinkski icmpc, form at SMT) probably due to the fact
that educators are picking up on the fact that cognitive abilities are
powerful predictors and need to be understood since they ineveitably
will play a role in pedagogical settings.

Before diving into a discussion regarding differences in cognitive
ability, I should note that sometimes ideas regarding differnces in
cognitive ability been hostily recieved (citation against people talking
about IQ) and for good reasons. Research in this area can and has been
taken advantage to further dangerous ideologies (Bell Curve), but often
arguments that assert meaningful differences in cognitiev abilites
between groups are founed on statistical misunderstandings and have been
debunked in other literature (measure of man). With that cleared out of
the way, it is very hard to mantain a scientific commitment to the
theory of evolution (Darwin) and not expect variation in all aspects of
human behavior, with cognition falling within that umbrella.

Attempting to measure aspects of cognition go back over a century. Even
before concepts of intelligence were posited by Charles Spearman and his
conception of \emph{g} (Spearman, 1904), scientists were intersted in
finding links between an individual's mental abilities and some sort of
physical manifestation. This area of research was pretty dark and kind
of implicitly was all about validating preconceutalized ideas that
people had on the superiority of peoples, with white dudes always comign
out on top. For example, THIS GUY WHO TRIED TO QUANTIFY GREATNESS Also
this guy who basically measured people's skull sizes. But of course this
stuff is not meaningful at all, especially when the dependent variable
in this was so subjective and constrained by a culture where one ruling
people (white dudes) had all the power.

I only mention this because this line of thinking was co-opted by the
American herediterian school of IQ (page 187 in Gould), where people
that were after the same sort of idea (superiority of white people)
basically took ideas of Alfred Binet, one of the first people to begin
to systematically investigate cognitive ability in children at request
of the french governement so that children who were, what today we would
call learning disabled, could be identified and given special attention.
Binet also took a lot of inspiration from Broca, WHO I TALK ABOUT ABOVE
ON SKULL SIZE.

Bient was the initial developer of the idea of an intelligence quotient
(divide mental age by chronological age then multiply by 100) and
provided one of the first ways to attempt to measure something that was
not capable of being manifested in the phsysical world. Around the same
time have people like Cyrial Burt and Charles spearmean developing new
theories of intelligence based on the reification factor analysis and
calling it g that is based on solving problems without prior knowledge.

sentence here about g and the postive manifold

Of course took this aside to talk about that basiclaly Binet and
Spearman's ideologies about what can be measusred still represent two of
the largest schools of thought on ways to meausre cognitive ability. On
one hand there idea that cognitive abilities are based upon a steady
growth of incoming information that someone is able to manipulate once
they retrieve from long term memory, the other hand is that in addition
to that there is some sort of construct in the mind that differs between
people that can singularly refelect their intelligence, often referred
to as g.

Basic assumption is that there is something in the brain here where
differences will lead to different behaviors. Without detailing entire
histories of this line of thought, Binet basically turned into an
argument for general crystalized intelligence, or DEFINITINO HERE
(citation). The Spearman, Burt strain of thought evolved into the
\emph{g} school, and recent reserach has suggested that the concept of
\emph{g} basically is statistcally equnivlient to idea conceptualized as
general fluid intelligence (cite that in POT). Both of these constructs
are powerful predictors on a large scale, but they don't explain the
entire picture.

Another large area in the field of cognitve psychology is the area of
working memory capacity. As noted in Cowan 2005, what the term refers
depends on the framework that is being used, but generally refers to the
amount of information that can be acvtively held in concsionus
representation, akin to short term memory, but with some important
caveats discssed below. In additon to concepts of intelligence, be it Gf
or Gc, the working memory capcity literature has done a lot of the heavy
theoretical lifting, and after reviewing it we will have a much better
idea of how once you decide about how you conceptualize it, then it's
helpful.

Given this brief background on cognitive ability, going to now dive
deeper into both working memory capcity, as well as general fluid
intelligence (avoid calling it \emph{g} for good reasons) and review
literature where these have been discussed as they relate to research on
music perception, thus being related to melodic dictation, a skill that
you need to percieve music to be able to do?

\hypertarget{working-memory-capacity}{%
\subsection{Working Memory Capacity}\label{working-memory-capacity}}

As noted by Berz 1994, tasks of melodic dictation are basically tasks of
working memory.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \citep{berzWorkingMemoryMusic1995}
\end{itemize}

Quoting from him directly

\begin{quote}
Here is his quote
\end{quote}

Clearly, would be worth understanding the concept at a deeper level
since clealry they have done a lot of great work on the topic. Adoptiong
chrnological take of the history of research the heavy hitters are *
Attkinson and Shriff * Miller 1956 and why that is a bad idea * Baddely
and Hitch * Nelson Cowan + need for complex span

For reasons discussed on p 18 of cowan 2005 and page 42 , choose to
adopot a Cowanian view where WMC is basically the window of attention.
Additinally it's worth noting initially that you can't directly apply
these frameworks to memory for musical material because after reading
page 109 in Cowan, important to note that all melodies appear in serial
order. To make analogous task based on something like complex span
tasks, would need to take certain set of notes and then always a finate
setb be played back in arandom order (see chatper 3)

So while for my purposes, I will refer to it as listed on page 1 of
Cowan 2005:

\begin{quote}
\protect\hyperlink{working-memory-capacity}{Working memory capacity}
refers to the relativly small amount of information that one can hold in
mind, attend to, or, technically speaking, maintain in a rapidly
accesible state at one time. The term working is mean to indicate that
meantal work requres use of such informaiton. (p.1{]})
\end{quote}

But in the literature below I comment on which definitional framework is
used if relevant to the reporting of it all.

As discussed above gf has a long history, some good some bad. Thing is
that it can be really predictive of many things and people def do try
incoproate it into music research.

One of the big problems with this is establishing effects of causality
looking at music. Could be that factors outside of music play a role
like persanal views of ability (Daniel paper), socio economic status,
and personality. And field is even big enough to have null results

Standing in contrast to factors that individuals do not have a much
control over such as the size of their working memory capapacity or
factors related to their general fluid intelligence, most of the factors
we believe contribute to someone's abililty to take melodic dictation
have to deal with factors related to training and the envirionment. In
fact, one of the tacit assumptions of getting a music degree revolves
around the implictly held belief that with delibrate and attentive
practice, that an individual is able to move from novice to expertise in
their chosen domain. The idea that time invested results in beneficial
returns is probably best exemplified by work produced by ANDERS ERICKSON
1993 that suggests that performance at more elite levels has to do with
delibreate practice. Below I review literature that supports this
argument, since it's no doubt that someone has to engage in something to
be good at it.

FROM FANTSTIC

Phrase summary features that summarise the content of a melodic phrase,
conceptually similar to the features that Steinbeck (1982) proposed but
incorporating as well recent knowledge and techniques on tonality
induction and melodic contour. Repetition features that measure the
repetitiveness of short melodic-rhythmic sequences or motives (called
m-types) which are the building blocks of melodies. These features are
mainly inspired by characteristic text constants from computational
linguistics that describe the frequency distribution of words in written
text (see Baayen, 2001). Features based on the frequencies and frequency
densities of phrase summary features in a corpus of pop music. These
features build on the assumption that the frequency with which melodic
features appear in real music are very important for music cognition
(Huron, 2006). Features that are based on the corpus-derived frequencies
of m-types as building blocks of melodies. These features are motivated
by the important role that word frequencies play in text information
retrieval and text categorisation (Landau et al., 2007) and verbal
memory (Tse and Altarriba, 2007).

a taxnomy of these based on what already has done. Suggest that there
are both individual as well as musical features that are at play here.
Individual features can be either cognitive, sort of fixed, or
environemental, having do with training. Musical features can be either
structural, or experimental like how you play the melody. None of these
are nessecariy hard and fast divisions, and certainly there are going to
be some interactions between any and all of the levels. Clearly a very
great question and given how much we look at it, want to know more about
this complicated network of proccesses. Given this laundry list of
factors, now going to explore the individual parameters in Chapter 3,
the musical chapters in 4 and 5, as well as how they would come together
in chapter 6. Also will then go into more detail about many of the
papers that I mentioned. Really there should be a chapter 7 where after
thinking about all of this I put together a computational model that
succcedes at incorporating a polymorphic view of musical trianing by
making a proces model inspired by Karpinki that is able to be both a
research and pedagogical stepping off point for futre reserach on
modeling melodic dictation.

  too.
\item

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \citep{cowanWorkingMemoryCapacity2005} -- This book will probably
  serve as cornerstone of chapter in terms of creating relevant
  literature in addition to EE course readings on WMC. Provides history
  of WMC models and notes how attention based model as opposed to
  Baddely loop might actually be better theoretical model for talking
  about fact that WMC could just be something related to attention if
  not that. Provides extensive listing on problems with chunking that
  are all relevant to music, but then also supports it. Shows that
  Miller 1956 is a generally bad citation, own author even says that in
  Miller 1989 (check and add) and says limit is probably about 4 (use
  Cowan 2001 for ctation find that). Lots of good ideas like how music
  is always serial recall, examples of how to model the process, great
  discussions on zooming out and categorical nature of music within span
  of WMC ideas.
\item
  \citep{ockelfordMusicModuleWorking2007} -- uses case of savant to
  argue bits of Berz WM Music Model
