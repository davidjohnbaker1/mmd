(Tallarico 1974) – Long boring talk on STM, LTM (Oura 1991) – Awful experimental design that says people use structual tones (Buonviri 2014) – Call for experimental, suggestions as to what factors might contribute, use of deductive reasoning, qualitative (Nathan O. Buonviri 2015) – People need to focus right away, not establish, distractors (N. Buonviri 2015) – Showing people visual music does not help much. (Buonviri 2017) – Listening helps with other things, no best strategy in terms of writing (Nathan O Buonviri and Paney 2015) – Literature to say people are bad at teaching melodic dictation and we don’t know a lot about it, also interesting stuff about what solfege systems people use (Butler 1997) – Call for music educators to do aural skills research, notes problem with aural skills pedagogy in lack of direction, also nice Nicholas Cook quotes on point of theory (Furby 2016) – music ed study with weird stats, has references to follow up on with advantages of pitch systems and people who reccomend things for sight singing (Pembrook 1986) – Effects of melodies, also how people do it. Interesting that they too effect of melodies, but talka bout things in terms of notes and not in terms of information content. Thought ot have an experiment where the n-grams that are more common are easier to write down. Lots of good charts too. (Paney 2016) – It’s not good if you tell people what to do when they are dictating, article has a lot of good review for dictation materials to add to the ‘toRead’ folder. (Fournier et al. 2017) – Good references that people are awful at Aural Skills, Also suggestions that people are not that great at transfer, and some stuff to suggest academic abililty is intertwined in all of this. Good reference for when starting to talk about untangling the mess that is aural skills. (???) – Add on a new module to the WMC model of baddel with music, presents some evidence for why this theoretically should be included, but actually takes examples of dictation. A lot of this article felt like things that i was reinventing…not good. (???) – Proof some other people are starting to think in terms of pedagogical schemas (Klonoski 2000) – Music cognition needs to talk to aural skills more, also need to unbind theory routine with aural skills and think of things more as in a perceptual learning hierarchy (Klonoski 2006) – great quotes that when people get something wrong with aural skills, what does that even mean, lack of transfer effects, article ends with ways to get better at things (Pembrook and Riggins 1990) – Survey of what people in the late 1980s were doing in terms of aural skills pedagogy (???) – addresses why Gary Karpinski thinks we should teach melodic dictation (Potter 1990) – dictation teacher surprised that people don’t keep up their dictaiton skills quote 8.2 Chapter 3 (Cowan 2005) – This book will probably serve as cornerstone of chapter in terms of creating relevant literature in addition to EE course readings on WMC. Provides history of WMC models and notes how attention based model as opposed to Baddely loop might actually be better theoretical model for talking about fact that WMC could just be something related to attention if not that. Provides extensive listing on problems with chunking that are all relevant to music, but then also supports it. Shows that Miller 1956 is a generally bad citation, own author even says that in Miller 1989 (check and add) and says limit is probably about 4 (use Cowan 2001 for ctation find that). Lots of good ideas like how music is always serial recall, examples of how to model the process, great discussions on zooming out and categorical nature of music within span of WMC ideas. (Ockelford 2007) – uses case of savant to argue bits of Berz WM Music Model References "]
