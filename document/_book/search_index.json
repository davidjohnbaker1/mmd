Melodic dictation is a cognitively demanding process that requires students to listen to a melody, retain it in memory, and then use their knowledge of Western musical notation in order to recreate the mental image of the melody on paper in a limited time frame. As of 2018 there are 647 Schools of Music belonging to National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) CITE WEBSITE, meaning that hundereds of students every year will be expected to learn this challenging task as part of their Aural Skills education. The logic being that as one improves in their abiliy to take melodic dictation, this practice of critical and active listening develops as a means to improve one’s ability to “think in music” and thus become a more compotent musician. While learning Aural Skills has been a hallmark of being educated within the Western conservatory tradition, the rationale behind both the how and why of aural skills is often thought of as being esoteric. Throughout the past century, people have disagreed on exactly how one does go about learning a melody with different areas of research each attacking the problem from a different angle. Despite its ubiqiquity in curricula within School of Music settings, research on topics pertain to how aural skills are acquired is limited at best. [Citations here about the cosntant calls butler, klondoski, pembrook] The fields of music theory and cognitive psychology are best positioned to make progress on this question, but often the skills required to be well versed ein ither of these subjects are disparate, published in other journals, and the research with overlap is scarce. This problem is not new and there have been repeated attempts to bridge the gap between practioners of aural skills and people in cognitive psycholgy CITES. Literature from music theory has establisehd conceptual frameworks regarding aural skills Karpinski (2000) and the relavint cognitive psychology literature has explored factors that might contribute to melodic perception (SCHMUKLER SYNERR 2016 2016), and there exists applied literature from the world of music education (CITES). However, despite these siloed areas of research, we as music researchers do not have an a concrete understanding of exaclty what contributes to HOW individuals learn melodies (HALPERNBARLETT2010). This is peculiar since “how does one learn a melody” seems to be one of the fundamental questions to the fields of music theory, music psychology, as well as music education. Given this lack of understanding, it becomes even more peculiar that this lack of convergence of evidence is then unable to provide a solid baseline as to what student in their aural skills classrooms can be expected to do. (Also something about we should really know this if we are going to grade people on this ability). While no single dissertation can solve any problem completely, this dissertation aims to fill the gap in the literature between aural skills practitioners (theorists and educators) and music psychologists in order to reach conclusion that can be applied systematically in pedagogical contexts. In order to do this I draw both literatures (music and science) in order to demonstrate how tools from both cognitive psychology as well as computational musicology can help move both fields forward. Some line here about if we really want to understand what is happening we need to know about causal factors going on here and have experimental manipulation and things like making models of the whole thing or talk about what Judea Pearl thinks about the ability to do some sort of causal modeling with diagrams. Great to rely on some sort of anecdoatal evidence, but if we are going to put things on the line with our education then we need to be able to make some sort of falsifiable claims about what we are doing. Can only do that through the lens of science. 1.1 Claims about need to join the worlds of theory and pedagogy (Butler 1997) (Klonoski 2000) - perceptual hierarchy, not enough info from aural skills training (Karpinski 2000) - “There is indeed a gap between the disciples of music cognition and aural skills training”, GK says that one of his goals is to bridge that gap, and he does. 1.2 Chapter Overview In this first chapter, I introduce the process of melodic dictation and discuss factors that would presumably could play a role in taking melodic dictation. The chapter introduces both a theoretical backgorund and rationale for using method form both computational musicology and congitive psychology in order ot answr quesitona bout how individuals learn melodies. I argue that tools for understanding this best because as we currently understand it, I see us operating in a Kuhnian normal science where much can be learned by just using the tools in front of us. This chapter will clearly outline the factors hypothesized to contribute to an individual’s abilit to learn melodies, incorporating both individual and musical parameters. The chapter ends with a discussion some of the philosophical/theoretical problems with attempting to measure thigns like this (is it just a party trick?) and establishes that I will be taking a more polymorphic view of musicianship in order to answer this question. The second chapter of my dissertation focuses on the history and current state of aural skills pedagogy. Tracing back its origins to the practical need to teach musical skills back with Guido d’Arezzo, I compare and contrast the different methodological approaches that have been used, along with their goals. The third chapter discusses previous work that examines individual factors thought to contribute to one’s ability to perform an aural skills task, and it will discuss results from an experiment contributing to a discussion of how individual differences could contribute to how a person learns melodies. Turning away from individual differences and focusing on musical features, in the fourth chapter I plan to discuss how music researchers can use tools from computational musicology as predictive features of melodies. Inspired by work from computational linguistics and information theory, recent work in computational musicology has developed software capable of abstracting features thought to be important to learning melodies, such as note density and ‘tonalness’ (Müllensiefen, 2009). Talk a bit about how this has been also looked at before in the music education community. While these features have been used in large scale, exploratory studies, work in this chapter will discuss how these features could be used in controlled, experimental studies as a stand-in for the intuition many music pedagogues have when determining difficulty of a melody in a classroom setting. In my fifth chapter, I introduce a novel corpus of over 600 digitized melodies encoded in a queryable format. This dataset will also serve as a valuable resource for future researchers in music, psychology, and the digital humanities. This chapter begins with a discussion of the history of corpus studies, noting their origin outside of music, their current state in music, and their limitations. This chapter, encapsulating the encoding process, the sampling criteria, and the situation of corpus methodologies within the broader research area, will go over summary data and also talk about how it could be used to generate hypotheses for future experiemnts (n-gram stuff based on patterns) . Lastly, in the final chapter, I will synthesize the previous research in a series of melodic dictation experiments. Stimuli for the experiments are selected based on the abstracted features of the melodies and are manipulated as independent variables based on the previous theoretical literature. I then model responses from the experiments using both individual factors and musical features in order to predict how well an individual performs in behavioral tasks similar to some of my previously published research (Baker &amp; Müllensiefen, 2017). Here I also note important caveats in scoring melodic dictation, referencing some other of my own work on using metrics, such as edit distance (Baker &amp; Shanahan, 2018), to discuss similarities between the correct answer and an individual’s attempts at dictation. Results from the final chapter will be discussed with reference to how findings are applicable to pedagoges in aural skills settings. Recommendations will be made building on current conceptual frameworks (Karpinski, 2000). References "],

Melodic dictation is the process in which an individual hears a melody, retains it in memory, and then uses their knowledge of Western musical notation to recreate the mental image of it on paper in a limited time frame. For many, becoming profiecent at this task is at the core of developing one’s aural skills (Karpinski 1990). For over a century, music pedagoges have highly valued melodic dictation1 and most aural skills texts that have sections devoted to honing one’s listening skills have material on melodic dictation (Karpinski 2000). Additionally, any school acredited by the North American Schools of Music requires learning this skill be part of any acredited curriula. Yet despite this tradition and ubiquity, the rationales as to why it is important for students to learn this ability often comes from some sort of appeal to tradition or underwhelming anecdotal evidence that time spent learning to take melodic dictation results in increases in near transfer abilities after they have acquired a certain degree of profieency. Rationales given for why students should learn melodic dictation has even been described by Gary Karpinski as being based on “compratively vauge aphorisms about mental relationships and intelligent listenings” (Karpinski 1990, 192), with the argument for learning to take melodic dictation historically not being well supported with persuasive evidence. Some researchers have even taken a more skeptical stance and have noted that the rationale for why we teach melodic dictation deserves more critique. For example, Klonoski in writing about aural skills education aptly questions “What specific deficiency is revelaned with an incorrect reponse in melodic dictaiton settings?” (Klonoski 2006). Earlier researchers like Potter, in their own publication, have noted that they have been baffled that many musicians do not actually keep up with their melodic dictation abilities after the classs ends (Potter 1990), but presumably go on to have sucessful and fulfilling musical lives. Additionally, suggesting that people who can hear music and then are unable to write it down, and thus are unable to think in music, seems somewhat exclusionary to the vast amount of musical cultures out there that do not depend on any sort of written notation. Though despite this skepticism towards the topic, melodic dictation remains at the forefront of many aural skills classrooms. While the act of becoming better at this skill may or may not lead to large in increases in far transfer of ability, as a pedagogical tool, teaching students to take melodic dictation brings with it the concepts that are hoped to be instilled in music students long term. While not there has not been extensive research on melodic dictation research in the past few years, in fact (Paney 2016) notes that since 2000, only four studies were published that directly examined melodic dictation, this skill set sits on the border between literature on learning, melodic perception, memory, and music theory pedagogy and understanding and modeling exactly how it works remains as a untapped watershed of knowledge for the field of music theory, music education, and music perception and is deserving of much more attention. 2.1.1 Describing Melodic Dictation Much of the foundational work on the topic of melodic dictation comes from the work of Gary Karpinski. Summerized most recently in his Aural Skills Acquisition (Karpinski 2000), though first presented in an earlier article (Karpinski 1990), Karpinski proposes his own model of melodic dictation that provides a four step framework as how the process of melodic dictation works.2 His four steps include: Hearing Short Term Melodic Memory Musical Understanding Notation and occur as a looping, schematic process that is depicted in Figure 3.1 in his textbook, reproduced below and htroughout the chapter Karpinski discusses relevant factors at play at each stage. In the case of the table above, the process happens twice, presumably with a melody that can be extracted in two parts, which according to Karpinski and this prescribed formulas would consist of a melody from twelve to twent notes long for listenrs with few or no chunking abilities. Reviewing the Karpinksi four step model will provide both a grounding in the current model that has been used in other litearture, and establish a groundwork from which to build. The hearing stage involves the initial peceptions of the sound at a physical level of the tympanic membrane, as well as the listener’s attention to the incoming musical information. If the listener is not actively engaging in the task because of factors like “bordeom, lack of discipline, test anxiety, attention defict disorder, or any number of other causes” then any futher processes down the model will be determentially effected. While Karpinski nots that these types of interference are normally “beyond the traditional juristiction of aural skills instruction”, I will later argue that the concept of willfull attention when reconceptualized as working memory capacity, may actually play a large role in the melodic dictation process. The short-term melodic memory Karpinski relies on empirical qualitative evidence from interview with students to show support for two separate memory encoding mechanisms, one for contour, and one for pitch. After citing literature supporting this claim (DOWLING 1978, DeWITT AND CROWDWER 1986, DOWLING 1994) regarding contour, as well as litertuare suggesting that in order to memorize chunks of melodic material, it helps to have been enculturated (DEUTSCH 1977,Oura and Hatano 1988, Handel 1989, Davies 1978, Dowling 1990) (a field of research that has been explored a lot since this was published PEARCE WORK), Karpinksi explains how ideas like extractive listening and chunking then take part in this process. Noting that there is probably some sort of capacity limit to music, citing Miller (1956) and corroborating musical evidence (Marple n.d)3, Karpinski details the two stragegies from above to show how the dictation process is done. Karpinski’s extractive listening refers to only selectively remembering parts of a melody. The chunking bit isa an idea that as musical understanding increases, so does musical memory. The idea is that if you can identify certain ideas that you hear in the incoming signal, you can more effectively undertand them. In order to further explain the idea of musical understanding Karpinski says its different ha musical memory. Musical memory for Karpinski is ability to repeat what has been heard, and understanding is about comprehending things like the hierarchical metrical relationships between notes, rhythmic groupings and tonal functions. Within this whole idea is the thing of solimization for both rhythm and pitch (the takdimiti system KODALY) and relative pitch. Idea here is that hte two are then going to be linked to one another and as information comes in that can be musically understood, then it can then be moved from perception to notation more quickly. The notation, and final step of the dictation loop, require the knowledge of Western musical notation to be able to write down what is in one’s musical short term memory and use their musical understanding to decode that mental representation into written notation. This last step is ripe for errors as Karpinski notes has been foudn in other areas of research TAYLOR AND PEMBROOK 1983 and its noted that obviously it’s very hard to write something down if you don’t have the category for it. The final parts of the chapter, Karpinski notes that other factors like tempo, the length and number of playings, and the duration between playings will also play a role in determining how an individual will perform on a melodic dictation. While this framework can help illuminate this cognitive process and help pedagogues understand how to best help their students, the model as it stands is not detialed enough for explanatory purposes and does not exhaust many factors that further research since its publicaiton have demonstrated as relevant making a model of melodic dictation. Again, though Karpinski did not intent to create an exhaustive model of the melodic dictaiton process, by only creating a verbal model, the model is unprepared to handle a few basic things. Primarily, having a single model for melodic dictation assumes that all individuals are likely to engage in this sequential ordering of events. This could in fact be the case, but there is research ANDREW GOLDMAN AND STUFF that suggests that experts process and categorize musical information differently. Additionally, different people will probably have different experiences dictating melodies based on their own past listening experience, a note that Karpinski makes earlier when THAT CITATION FROM UP ABOVE. Not only will there be differences in ability, additionally people differ in their cognitive abilities. The model does not have any flexibility in terms of individual differences. Secondly, the model also does not seem to treat melodies differently. For example, on page 103, Karpinski suggest that two passes should be adequate for a listern with few to no chunking skills to listen to be able to dictate a melody of twelve to twenty notes. This also would be an area of model improvement, as both the melodies listed below here are XX notes, within Karpinski’s prescribed range, but intuition might suggest that the melodies are not equally difficult to dictate. The model is agnostic towards differences in melodies. While the Karpinski model provides a starting point for the sequential framework for modeling melodic dictation, there is still a wealh of parameters that could contribute to this process. From an empirical standpoint, both the task as well as the process of melodic dictation as depicted by Karpinksi resemble something that can be turned into an experiment, as well as a computational model. It’s basically an experiment where we have in person level predictors and melodies with different item level difficulty. This dissertation seeks to explore the degree to which methodologies from cognitive psychology and computational musicology are able to further this literature and take the next logical step in terms of understanding aural skills. 2.1.1.1 Individual Factors to contribute From an individual stand point, can bifurcate factors broadly into cognitive factors, or factors of people that are relatively consistent over people or basically like fixed effects things (use definiton of what is a fixed effect); and the other side of this would be things that would have to be delt with that change with training and exposure. Going to refer to this second set of things as Environmental factors. Is there a better way to talk about this as nature vs nurture. Addiitonally need to then mention that there are of course epigenitic factors where both of these parameters might interact with one another. For example, might then imagine that someone with higher cognitive abilitty, lots of training that was put forward by their parents, as well as tons of musical training, and personality traits that are more likely to learn more (daniels paper on that) might be different in terms of resutls than someone with lower cognitive abilities, no training, low SES, and a general inclination not to even take music lessons. While obvious, what will eventually be of interest is the degree to which each of these things contributes to the final models. Also gives us a better idea about pedagogy and what not. 2.1.1.2 Musical factors to contribute In addition to differences at the individual level, there are also musical level characteristics. In this category it is also worth taxonimizing the musical characterstics into two categories as well. On one hand we have the structural aspects of the melody itself. These are aspects of the melody that would remain invariant when written down on a score. Reading from left to right, would be things like range, key, time signature, intervals, amount of notes, contour of the melody, tonal properties, standardized note density. Then the other side would be musical features that I am going to deem as experiemntal features of the melody. These are aspects of the structure of hte melody that you can then warp within the context of a melodic dictiation such as tempo, which then refelcts note density, timbral qualities, how many times the melody is played, the space between hearings. This is not a categorial divide, while I put something like range as key of the melody as structural, you could imagine that you could have hte same interval invariant structure of a melody , perhaps Twinkle, Twinkle little star begginging on C2 noteated in bass cleff, but then imagine the the same “melody” being played two and a half octaves up on F#4, and transposed to minor and played quicker leading ot a phenomenologically similar experience, but not the same. I taxonimze them early on, but again note that a model of this should be able withstand the multitude of patterns that exist. 2.1.1.3 Make a Model of them Given all of these factors that then go into the melodic dictaiton process, the remainder of this chapter will detail previous reserach that has gone into each of these factors. Talking about each one will provide rationale for why it should be further investigated if we are to better understand melodic dictation. Beginning with cognitive factors two levels, then go on to talk about musical features. After discussing both and their two subcompoents as I have taxonimzed them, offer a brief discussion on how it’s bad to think about these as just latent abilities. Instead talk about thinking about modeling melodic dictaiton, in terms of ACTUAL MODELING, as polymorphic conceptualization of aural skills. This is important because how we talk about and model things reflects or values and often it will get in the way of stuff. message(&quot;Diagram&quot;) ## Diagram # library(DiagrammeR) # # grViz(&quot; # digraph boxes_and_circles { # # # a &#39;graph&#39; statement # graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10] # # # several &#39;node&#39; statements # node [shape = box, # fontname = Helvetica] # Individual ; Musical ; Cognitive ; Environmental ; Structural ; Experimental # # node [shape = box] // sets as circles # WMC; Gf; CowanList; Musical_Training; Aural_Training; # Interval_Structure; Times_Played; Tempo; AuralSkills # # # several &#39;edge&#39; statements # AuralSkills -&gt; Individual # AuralSkills -&gt; Musical # Individual -&gt; Cognitive # Individual -&gt; Environmental # Musical -&gt; Structural # Musical -&gt; Experimental # Cognitive -&gt; WMC # Cognitive -&gt; Gf # Cognitive -&gt; CowanList # Environmental -&gt; Musical_Training # Environmental -&gt; Aural_Training # Structural -&gt; Interval_Structure # Experimental -&gt; Times_Played # Experimental -&gt; Tempo # } # # &quot;) 2.2 Individual Factors 2.2.1 Cognitive Research from the cognitive psychology literature suggests that individuals differ in their percetual and cognitive abilities in ways that are not easily influenced by short term-training (cite) and that these abilities, when investigated on a large scale are predictive of a wealth of human behavior from RICHIE CITATIONS. If literature exists that suggests that cognitive abilites are sucessful predictors of things related to something like academic achievement, it worth investigating the extent that these abilities might play when modeling melodic dictation. This is also important to understand because if we were to find out that something as simple as general fluid intelligence was a strong predictor in musical tasks that we are grading people on, it would be pretty unfair to do since we are then basiclly grading people on genetic factors beyond their control, as well as environmental factors shown to have some sort of effect on IQ (Richie paper again). Recenlty there has been a surge of interest in this area (nancy rogers, LVH, utah guy, karinkski icmpc, form at SMT) probably due to the fact that educators are picking up on the fact that cognitive abilities are powerful predictors and need to be understood since they ineveitably will play a role in pedagogical settings. Before diving into a discussion regarding differences in cognitive ability, I should note that sometimes ideas regarding differnces in cognitive ability been hostily recieved (citation against people talking about IQ) and for good reasons. Research in this area can and has been taken advantage to further dangerous ideologies (Bell Curve), but often arguments that assert meaningful differences in cognitiev abilites between groups are founed on statistical misunderstandings and have been debunked in other literature (measure of man). With that cleared out of the way, it is very hard to mantain a scientific commitment to the theory of evolution (Darwin) and not expect variation in all aspects of human behavior, with cognition falling within that umbrella. Attempting to measure aspects of cognition go back over a century. Even before concepts of intelligence were posited by Charles Spearman and his conception of g (Spearman, 1904), scientists were intersted in finding links between an individual’s mental abilities and some sort of physical manifestation. This area of research was pretty dark and kind of implicitly was all about validating preconceutalized ideas that people had on the superiority of peoples, with white dudes always comign out on top. For example, THIS GUY WHO TRIED TO QUANTIFY GREATNESS Also this guy who basically measured people’s skull sizes. But of course this stuff is not meaningful at all, especially when the dependent variable in this was so subjective and constrained by a culture where one ruling people (white dudes) had all the power. I only mention this because this line of thinking was co-opted by the American herediterian school of IQ (page 187 in Gould), where people that were after the same sort of idea (superiority of white people) basically took ideas of Alfred Binet, one of the first people to begin to systematically investigate cognitive ability in children at request of the french governement so that children who were, what today we would call learning disabled, could be identified and given special attention. Binet also took a lot of inspiration from Broca, WHO I TALK ABOUT ABOVE ON SKULL SIZE. Bient was the initial developer of the idea of an intelligence quotient (divide mental age by chronological age then multiply by 100) and provided one of the first ways to attempt to measure something that was not capable of being manifested in the phsysical world. Around the same time have people like Cyrial Burt and Charles spearmean developing new theories of intelligence based on the reification factor analysis and calling it g that is based on solving problems without prior knowledge. sentence here about g and the postive manifold Of course took this aside to talk about that basiclaly Binet and Spearman’s ideologies about what can be measusred still represent two of the largest schools of thought on ways to meausre cognitive ability. On one hand there idea that cognitive abilities are based upon a steady growth of incoming information that someone is able to manipulate once they retrieve from long term memory, the other hand is that in addition to that there is some sort of construct in the mind that differs between people that can singularly refelect their intelligence, often referred to as g. Basic assumption is that there is something in the brain here where differences will lead to different behaviors. Without detailing entire histories of this line of thought, Binet basically turned into an argument for general crystalized intelligence, or DEFINITINO HERE (citation). The Spearman, Burt strain of thought evolved into the g school, and recent reserach has suggested that the concept of g basically is statistcally equnivlient to idea conceptualized as general fluid intelligence (cite that in POT). Both of these constructs are powerful predictors on a large scale, but they don’t explain the entire picture. Another large area in the field of cognitve psychology is the area of working memory capacity. As noted in Cowan 2005, what the term refers depends on the framework that is being used, but generally refers to the amount of information that can be acvtively held in concsionus representation, akin to short term memory, but with some important caveats discssed below. In additon to concepts of intelligence, be it Gf or Gc, the working memory capcity literature has done a lot of the heavy theoretical lifting, and after reviewing it we will have a much better idea of how once you decide about how you conceptualize it, then it’s helpful. Given this brief background on cognitive ability, going to now dive deeper into both working memory capcity, as well as general fluid intelligence (avoid calling it g for good reasons) and review literature where these have been discussed as they relate to research on music perception, thus being related to melodic dictation, a skill that you need to percieve music to be able to do? 2.2.2 Working Memory Capacity As noted by Berz 1994, tasks of melodic dictation are basically tasks of working memory. (Berz 1995) Quoting from him directly Here is his quote Clearly, would be worth understanding the concept at a deeper level since clealry they have done a lot of great work on the topic. Adoptiong chrnological take of the history of research the heavy hitters are * Attkinson and Shriff * Miller 1956 and why that is a bad idea * Baddely and Hitch * Nelson Cowan + need for complex span For reasons discussed on p 18 of cowan 2005 and page 42 , choose to adopot a Cowanian view where WMC is basically the window of attention. Additinally it’s worth noting initially that you can’t directly apply these frameworks to memory for musical material because after reading page 109 in Cowan, important to note that all melodies appear in serial order. To make analogous task based on something like complex span tasks, would need to take certain set of notes and then always a finate setb be played back in arandom order (see chatper 3) So while for my purposes, I will refer to it as listed on page 1 of Cowan 2005: Working memory capacity refers to the relativly small amount of information that one can hold in mind, attend to, or, technically speaking, maintain in a rapidly accesible state at one time. The term working is mean to indicate that meantal work requres use of such informaiton. (p.1]) But in the literature below I comment on which definitional framework is used if relevant to the reporting of it all. 2.2.2.1 Papers that suggest WMC plays a role (Nichols, Wöllner, and Halpern 2018) Halpern paper on conductors Sight reading paper Summerize 2.2.3 General Intelligence As discussed above gf has a long history, some good some bad. Thing is that it can be really predictive of many things and people def do try incoproate it into music research. One of the big problems with this is establishing effects of causality looking at music. Could be that factors outside of music play a role like persanal views of ability (Daniel paper), socio economic status, and personality. And field is even big enough to have null results (include that catty comment of glenn schellenberg) Stuff on mozart effect Whole chapter from Schellenberg Swaminithan papers 2.2.3.1 Papers that suggest GF plays a role 2.2.4 Environmental 2.2.5 Long term memory and corpus with implicit Standing in contrast to factors that individuals do not have a much control over such as the size of their working memory capapacity or factors related to their general fluid intelligence, most of the factors we believe contribute to someone’s abililty to take melodic dictation have to deal with factors related to training and the envirionment. In fact, one of the tacit assumptions of getting a music degree revolves around the implictly held belief that with delibrate and attentive practice, that an individual is able to move from novice to expertise in their chosen domain. The idea that time invested results in beneficial returns is probably best exemplified by work produced by ANDERS ERICKSON 1993 that suggests that performance at more elite levels has to do with delibreate practice. Below I review literature that supports this argument, since it’s no doubt that someone has to engage in something to be good at it. 2.2.6 Musical Training It almost seems redundant to review literature in support of music practice leading to better results. List of those papers here 2.2.7 Aural Training Dictation has not been that well researched (Furby 2016) people try lots of things, not much evidence for peer tutoring (Furby 2016) ISOLATION OF RHTYM AND MELODY Banton 1995 Bland 1984 Root 1931 Wilson 1954 LISTENING BEFORE WRITING Banton 1995 RECOGNIZING PATTERNS Banton 1995 Bland 1984 Root 1931 SINGING SILENTLY WHEN DICRTAING (Klonoski 2006) 2.2.8 Sight Singing (Fournier et al. 2017) - catalogugig different strategizes used in sight signings four main categories 14 subcategories 2.2.9 To Sort Harrison 1994 2.3 Musical Factors 2.4 Structural Clealrly strutures also will play a role in this.

Buonviri and Paney 2015; Paney and Buonviri 2014) 2.4.5 Caveat about dilberate practice and talent Also should mention here that clealrly not a perfect one dimensional model where effort equals results. Simple thought expeiment that hard work does not always equal sucess in that there are sucssfull people who have not worked hard and very hard workers who do not experience sucess in what they do. Additionally people need to keep up the skills they have, insert hilarious quote here from potter not believing that people didnt keep up their melodic dictaiton skills and show that they are compartmentalized (Potter 1990) This of course does not nullify any findings on delibreate practice, but goes to show that the whole thing is kind of complicated. 2.4.6 Recent Computational Musicology Work papers and findings START HERE FOR WORD COUNT As noted above, in following studies XYZ, people have looked at musical features before me. Since then there have been a lot futher strides in the world of computational musicology.

Repetition features that measure the repetitiveness of short melodic-rhythmic sequences or motives (called m-types) which are the building blocks of melodies. These features are mainly inspired by characteristic text constants from computational linguistics that describe the frequency distribution of words in written text (see Baayen, 2001). Features based on the frequencies and frequency densities of phrase summary features in a corpus of pop music. These features build on the assumption that the frequency with which melodic features appear in real music are very important for music cognition (Huron, 2006). Features that are based on the corpus-derived frequencies of m-types as building blocks of melodies. These features are motivated by the important role that word frequencies play in text information retrieval and text categorisation (Landau et al., 2007) and verbal memory (Tse and Altarriba, 2007). open soure packge for computaitonal anlaysis XX features Comes from stats, music thoery, music cognition, computaitonal Linguatstic (GET THAT CITATION), MIR Summary Features M-type features Context medoling via intergration of a orpus for 2nd order features OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THIS Folk music Bartok 1936?

Additionally could be the point that things interact with each other. And on top of that we have the idea about levels of Explanation - SEE THAT WITH WIGGINS - SEE THAT WITH HOW COWAN 2005 ends his book 2.6 Modeling and Polymorphism of Ability Important here to note that unlike Harrison 1994, not really appropriate to conceptualize this as latenta bility. Very easy in statistical terms to talk about latent variables and be able to talk about lots of variance predictied. But problem with any sort of model like that or model of musical sophistcation is that it has same fate as g. QUOTES HERE FROM MS paper on latent variables Musicianship as a concept of something ot measure when talking about this one little task with relative lack of concrete evidence for it’s transfer, need to return back to a process model of melodic dictaiton. 2.6.1 Polymophic, component process makes you think about things in models Going to say here that LVs are bad and that need to adopt a more polymorphic view of musicianship as advocated by Levitin XXX Peretz 2006 2.7 Conclusions In this chapter I have first described what is melodic dictation, Karpinki’s verbal model of it, noted what the things were that were missing from this model as a stepping off point, then went on to suggest a taxnomy of these based on what already has done. Suggest that there are both individual as well as musical features that are at play here. Individual features can be either cognitive, sort of fixed, or environemental, having do with training. Musical features can be either structural, or experimental like how you play the melody. None of these are nessecariy hard and fast divisions, and certainly there are going to be some interactions between any and all of the levels. Clearly a very great question and given how much we look at it, want to know more about this complicated network of proccesses. Given this laundry list of factors, now going to explore the individual parameters in Chapter 3, the musical chapters in 4 and 5, as well as how they would come together in chapter 6. Also will then go into more detail about many of the papers that I mentioned. Really there should be a chapter 7 where after thinking about all of this I put together a computational model that succcedes at incorporating a polymorphic view of musical trianing by making a proces model inspired by Karpinki that is able to be both a research and pedagogical stepping off point for futre reserach on modeling melodic dictation. 2.7.1 Clearly we have factors that are thought to contribute, need to investigate them in full with each chapter 2.7.2 Not before first looking at why we are doing it in the first place (–transition to Chapter 2) References "],

Provides extensive listing on problems with chunking that are all relevant to music, but then also supports it. Shows that Miller 1956 is a generally bad citation, own author even says that in Miller 1989 (check and add) and says limit is probably about 4 (use Cowan 2001 for ctation find that). Lots of good ideas like how music is always serial recall, examples of how to model the process, great discussions on zooming out and categorical nature of music within span of WMC ideas.
