For many, becoming proficient at this task is at the core of developing one’s aural skills (Karpinski 1990). For over a century, music pedagogues have valued melodic dictation1 which is evident from the fact that most aural skills texts with content devoted to honing one’s listening skills have sections on melodic dictation (Karpinski 2000). Yet despite this tradition and ubiquity, the rationales as to why it is important for students to learn this ability often comes from some sort of appeal to tradition or underwhelming anecdotal evidence. The argument tends to go that time spent learning to take melodic dictation results in increases in near transfer abilities after an individual acquires a certain degree of proficiency learning to take melodic dictation. Rationales given for why students should learn melodic dictation has even been described by Karpinski as being based on “comparatively vague aphorisms about mental relationships and intelligent listening” (Karpinski 1990, 192), thus leaving the evidence for the argument for learning to take melodic dictation not being well supported. Some researchers have taken a more skeptical stance and asserted that the rationale for why we teach melodic dictation deserves more critique. For example, Klonoski in writing about aural skills education aptly questions “What specific deficiency is revealed with an incorrect response in melodic dictation settings?” (Klonoski 2006). Earlier researchers like Potter, in their own publications, have noted how they have been baffled that many musicians do not actually keep up with their melodic dictation abilities after their formal educaiton ends (Potter 1990), but presumably go on to have successful and fulfilling musical lives. Additionally, suggesting that people who can hear music and then are unable to write it down, thus are unable to think in music (Karpinski 2000), seems somewhat exclusionary to musical cultures that do not depend on any sort of written notation. Though despite this skepticism towards the topic, melodic dictation remains at the forefront of many aural skills classrooms. The act of becoming better at this skill may or may not lead to large in increases in far transfer of ability, but used as a pedagogical tool, the practice of learning to take melodic dictation intersects with concepts deemed relevant to the core of undergraduate music training. While there has not been extensive research on melodic dictation research in recent years– in fact Paney (2016) notes that since 2000, only four studies were published that directly examined melodic dictation– this skill set sits on the border between literature on music learning, melodic perception, memory, and music theory pedagogy. Understanding and modeling exactly how melodic dictation works remains as a untapped watershed of knowledge for the field of music theory, music education, and music perception and is deserving of more attention. In this chapter I examine literature both directly and indirectly related to melodic dictation by first reviewing the prominent four step model put forth by Karpinski in order to establish and describe what melodic dictation is. After describing his model, I then critique what this model lacks and clarify what is missing by providing a taxonomy of parameters that presumably would contribute to an individual’s ability to take melodic dictation. Using this taxonomy, I then review relevant literature and assert that the next steps forward in understanding how melodic dictation works come from examing the process both experimentally and computationally. It has been nearly two decades since Aural Skills Acquistion was first published as the first major step to finally build a bridge between the field of music cognition and music theory pedagogy (Butler 1997; Karpinski 2000; Klonoski 2000) and as with all public works, this infrastructure deserves attention and support. 2.1.1 Describing Melodic Dictation The foundational pedagogical work on melodic dictation comes from the work of Gary Karpinski. Summarized most recently in his Aural Skills Acquisition (Karpinski 2000)– though first presented in an earlier article (Karpinski 1990)– Karpinski proposes a four-step model of melodic dictation. The four steps of Karpinski’s model include Hearing Short Term Melodic Memory Musical Understanding Notation and occur as a looping process which I have reproduced depicted in Figure 2.1. The model is Karpinski’s take on previous attempts to summerize the process that Karpinksi notes has ranged from Michael Roger’s assertion of only needing two steps, to Ronald Thomas who claimed as many as 15 steps, to similar models proposed by Colin Wright that model inner hearing as a five step model (Wright 2016). Karpinski’s model is discussed extensively in both the original article (Karpinski 1990) and throughout the third chapter in his book (Karpinski 2000). I have reproduced his model in 2.1. Figure 2.1: Karpinski Idealized Flowchart of Melodic Dictation Karpinski’s hearing stage involves the initial perceptions of the sound at the psychoacoustical level and the listener’s attention to the incoming musical information. If the listener is not actively engaging in the task because of extrinsic factors such as “boredom, lack of discipline, test anxiety, attention deficit disorder, or any number of other causes pp. 65” then any further processes later down the model will be detrimentally effected. Karpinski notes that these types of interferences are normally “beyond the traditional jurisdiction of aural skills instruction pp. 65”, but I will later argue that the concept of willful attention, when re-conceptualized as working memory, may actually play a larger role in the melodic dictation process as it is modelled here. The short-term melodic memory stage in this process references the point in a melodic dictation where musical material is held in active memory. From Figure 2.1 and Karpinski’s writing on the model, this stage is not explictly declared as any sort of active process akin to a phonological loop (Baddeley 2000) where something like active rehearsal would occur, but describes where in the sequential order melodic informaiton is represented. Though Karpinski does not posit any sort of active process in the short term melodic memory stage, he does suggest there are two separate memory encoding mechanisms, one for contour, and one for pitch. He arrives at these two mechanisms by using both empirical qualitative interview evidence, as well as noting literature from music perception that supports this claim for contour (Dowling 1978; Dewitt and Crowder 1986) and literature suggesting that memory for melodic material is dependant on enculturation (Oura and Hatano 1988; Handel 1989; Dowling 1990). Since its publication in 2000, this area of research has expanded with other reearchers also demonstrating the effects of musical acculturation via exposure (Eerola, Louhivuori, and Lebaka 2009; Stevens 2012; Pearce and Wiggins 2012; Pearce 2018). In describing the short term melodic memory stage, Karpinksi also details two processes that he believes to be nesscary for this part of melodic dictation: extractive listening and chunking. Noting that there is a capacity limit to the perception of musical material, citing Miller (1956), Karpinski explains how each strategy might be used. Extractive listening is the process in which someone dictating the melody will selectivly remember only a small part of the melody in order to lessen the load on memory. Chunking is the process in which smaller musical elements can be fused together in order to expand how much information can be actively held in memory and manipulated. The concept of chunking is very helpful as a pedagogical tool, but as detailed below, is a complicated concept to formalize. After some musical material is extracted, then represented in memory, the next step in the process is musical understanding. At this point in the dictation, the individual taking the dictation needs to mentalize the extracted musical material that is represented in memory and the use their music theoretic knowledge in order to comprehend any sort of hierarchical relationships between notes, common rhythmic groupings, or any sorts of tonal functions. This is the point in the process where solimization of either or both pitch and rhythm, and musical material might be understood in terms of relative pitch. While Karpinski reserves his discussion of solmization for the musical understanding phase, it is worth questioning if it is possible to dissacociate relative pitch relations that would be ‘understood’ in this phase from the qualia of the tones themselves (Arthur 2018). For Karpinski, the quicker what is represented in musical memory can be understood, the quicker it can then be tranlated at the final step of notation. Notation, the final step of the dictation loop, requires that the individual taking the notation have sufficient knowledge of Western musical notation so that they are able to translate their musical understanding into written notation. This last step is ripe for errors and has proved problematic for researchers attempting to study dictation (Taylor and Pembrook 1983; Klonoski 2006). It is also worth highlighting is that it is difficult to notate musical material if the individual who is dictating does not have the requisite musical category and knowledge for the sounds. Lack of this knowledge will limit an individual’s ability to translate what is in their short term melodic memory into notation, even if it is perfectly represented in memory. The final parts of the chapter, Karpinski notes that other factors like tempo, the length and number of playings, and the duration between playings will also play a role in determining how an individual will perform on a melodic dictation. While this framework can help illuminate this cognitive process and help pedagogues understand how to best help their students, presumably there are many more factors that contribute to this process. The model as it stands is not detailed enough for explanatory purposes and lacks in two areas that would need to be expanded if this model were to be explored experimentally and computationally. First, having a single model for melodic dictation assumes that all individuals are likely to engage in this sequential ordering of events. This could in fact be the case2, but there is research from music perception (Goldman, Jackson, and Sajda 2018) and other areas of memory psychology such as work on expert chess players (Lane and Chang 2018) that suggests that as individuals gain more expertise, their processing and categorization of information changes. Additionally, different individuals will most likely have different experiences dictating melodies based on their own past listening experience, an area that Karpinski refers to when citing literature on musical enculturation based on statistical exposure. The model does not have any flexibility in terms of individual differences. Second, the model presumes the same sequence of events for every melody. As a general heurstic for communicating the process, this model serves as an excellent didiactic tool. Though when this model is applied to more diverse repertoire, this same set of strategies performed in this order might prove to be ineffecient. For example, on page 103 of his text, Karpinski suggest that two listenings should be adequate for a listener with few to no chunking skills to listen to be able to dictate a melody of twelve to twenty notes. This process might generalize to many tonal melodies, but presumably different strategies in recognition would be involved in dictating the two melodies of equal length shown in Figure 2.2 and 2.3. If asked to dictate 2.2, long term memory processes might begin to play a role much sooner during this task. If asked to dictate ??, establishing a tonal center to act as a perceptual scaffolding for relative relationships might prove to be more difficult. Presumably different people with different levels of abilities will perform differently on different melodies and while helpful as a pedaogogical tool, this generalized approach to melodic dictation could be more robust. Figure 2.2: Tonal Melody Figure 2.3: Atonal Melody This agnosticism for both variability for melodic and individual differences serves as a stepping off point for this study. In order to have a more complete understanding of melodic dictation, there needs to be a model that is able to accomodate the exhaustive differences at both the individual and musical levels. Additionally, the model should be able to be operationalized so that it can be explored in both experimental and computational settings. By explicitly stating variables thought to contribute and noting how melodic dictation works, it will give the community a better sense of the melodic dictation process, which will then enable a more complete understanding of melodic perception and subsequently allow for better teaching practices in aural skills classrooms. 2.1.2 Taxonomizing At this point, it is worth stepping back and noting that the sheer amount of variables at play here is cumbersome and haphazard. In order to better understand and organize factors thought to contribute to this process, it would be advantagous to taxonomize the multitude of features thought to contribute to melodic dictation. In doing this, it will allow for a clearer picture of what factors might contribute and what literatures to explore in order to learn more about them. The taxonomy that I propose appears in Figure 2.4 and bifucates the possible factors thought to affect an individual’s ability to take melodic dictation create both individual parameters and musical parameters. These categories are recursivley partitioned into cognitive and environmental parameters as well as structural and experimental factors respectively. Below I expand on what these categories entail, then explore each in-depth. Figure 2.4: Taxonomy of Factors Contributing to Aural Skills The individual parameters are split broadly into cognitive factors and environmental factors, Factors in the cognitive domain are assumed to be relatively consistent over time. Factors in the environmental domain can change with training and exposure. These categories are not deterministic, nor exclusive, and almost inevitably interact with one another. For example, it would be possible to imagine an individual with higher cognitive ability, the oppertunity to have a high degree of training early on in their musical career, and personality traits that lead them to enjoy engaging with a task like melodic dictation. This individual’s musical perception abilities might be markedly different than someone with lower cognitive abilities, no opertunity for individualized training, and not have a general inclination to even take music lessons. This variability at the individual level might then lead to differences in their ability to take melodic dictation. Complementing the individual differences, there would also be differences at the musical level which in turn divides into two categories. On one hand exists the structural aspects of the melody itself. These are aspects of the melody that would remain invariant when written down on musical notation that can only capture pitch changes over time. Parameters in this category would include features generated by the interval structure of the pitches over time that allow the melody to be perceieved as categorically distinct from other melodies. These structural features are then complimented by the experimental features which are emergent properties of the structrual relation of the pitches over time based on performance pratice choices. Examples of these parameters would include, key, tempo, note density, tonalness, timbral qualities, and the amount of times a melody is played during a melodic dictation. This division is not an exhaustive, categorical divide. One could imagine exceptions to these rules where a melody is tranformed to the minor key, ornamented, and then played with extenive rubato and experienced as a phenomenologically distinct, yet similiar experience. This division of structural and experimental features is morphologically similar to Leornard Meyer’s primary and secondary musical features (Meyer 1956). Given all of these parameters that could contribute to the melodic dictation process, the remainder of this chapter will exploring literature using this taxonomy as a guide. The chapter conculdes with a reflection on operationalizing each of these factors and problems that can arise in modeling and reminds the reader about the dangers of statistical reification. These are important to note since from an empirical standpoint, both the task as well as the process of melodic dictation as depicted by Karpinksi resemble something that could be operationalized as both an experiment, as well as a computational model. 2.2 Individual Factors 2.2.1 Cognitive Research from cognitive psychology suggests that individuals differ in their perceptual and cognitive abilities in ways that are both stable throughout a lifetime and are not easily influened by short term traning. When investigated on a large scale, these abilities– such as general intelligence or working memory capacity– predict a wealth of human behavior on a large scale ranging from longevity, annual income, ability to deal with stressful life events, and even the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (Ritchie 2015; Unsworth et al. 2005). Given the strength and generality of these predictors, it is worth investigating the extent that these abilities might contribute when investigating any modeling of melodic dictation since melodic dictation depends on perceptual abilities. It is imporant to understand the degree to which these cognitive factors might influence aural skills abilities in order to ensure that the types of assesments that are given in music schools validly measure abilities that individuals have the ability to improve. If it is the case that much of the variance in a student’s aural skills academic performance can be attributed to something the student has little control over, this would call for a serious upheaval of the current model of aural skills teaching and assesment. Recently there has been a surge of interest in work exploring how cognitive factors are related to abilities in music school. This interest is probably best explained by the fact that educators are picking up on the fact that cognitive abilities are powerful predictors and need to be understood since they inevitably will play a role in pedagogical settings. Before diving into a discussion regarding differences in cognitive ability, I should note that sometimes ideas regarding differences in cognitive ability been hostily received and for good reasons. Research in this area can and has been taken advantage to further specious ideologies, but often arguments that assert meaningful differences in cognitive abilities between groups are founded on statistical misunderstandings and have been debunked in other literature (Gould 1996). Considering that, it then becomes very difficult to maintain a scientific commitment to the theory of evolution (Darwin 1859) and not expect variation in all aspects of human behavior, with cognition falling within that umbrella. Even given this statement, measuring a theoretical construct such as an aspect of cognition deserves to be examined since the ability to validly and reliably measure an individual’s cognitive abilities is a fundmental assumption of this study. Attempting to measure and quantify aspects of cognition date back over a century. Even before concepts of intelligence were posited by Charles Spearman via his conception of g (Spearman 1904), scientists were interested in establishing links between latent constructs they presumed to exist in the real world– yet were impossible to measure directly like intelligence– and physical manifestations in that could be measured such as body morphology (Gould 1996). While scholars like Gould have documented and critiqued much of the history of early psychometrics3, central to this study are two important schools of thought on intelligence testing commonly discussed in the current literature. The first ideology originates from Cyril Burt and Charles Spearman who, in developing the statistical tool of factor analysis, posited that a construct of general intelligence exisits as a part of human cognition and can be quantified. Burt and Spearman claimed that a general intelligence factor existed in human cognition from evidence they found developing a battry of cognitive tests whose performance on one subtest could often reliabily predict performance on another. This phenomena of multiple related tests predicting each other’s performance is a manifestation referred to as the postive manifold. Spearman and Burt asserted that an individual’s ability to solve problems without contextual background information could be understood as general intellgience or g. Broadly speaking, the second ideology here stems from work by Alfred Bienet who instead of conceptualizing intelligence as a monolithic whole, partitioned intelligence into what have now become understood as differences in general crystallized intelligence or ( Gc ) and general fluid intelligence ( Gf ). General crystallized intelligence is the ability to solve problems given prior contextual information. General fluid intelligence is the ability to solve problems in novel contexts (Cattell 1971; J Horn 1994) . Comparing Gf and Gc to g, the cognitive psychology literature has noted that g often shares a statistically equivalent relationship to idea conceptualized as general fluid intelligence Gf. This distinction between Gf and Gc is different than that of g, but again it should be noted that g shares a statistically identical relationship with constructs such as Gf (Matzke, Dolan, and Molenaar 2010). These conceptions of intelligenec and cognitive ability also differ from more current theories that sythesize these previous areas of research (Kovacs and Conway 2016) using models that do not require taking an ontological stance of entity realism (Borsboom, Mellenbergh, and van Heerden 2003). Even though both of these constructs are powerful predictors on a large scale and do predict things like educational success, income, and even life expectancy (Ritchie 2015) when other variables like socioeconomic status are held constant, only conceptualizing cognitive abilities in terms of even a handful of latent constructs still does not fully explain the diversity of human cognition. Regardless of their origin, neglecting the predictive power of these variables in pedagogical settings would be a methodological oversight in attempting to explain variance in performance. Another second area in the field of cognitive psychology worht of examination is working memory capacity. In addition to concepts of intelligence, be it Gf or Gc, the working memory capacity literature directly relates to work on melodic dictation for reasons discussed below. Working memory is one of the most investigated concepts in the cognitive psychology literature. According to Nelson Cowan, the term working memory generally refers to the relatively small amount of information that one can hold in mind, attend to, or, technically speaking, maintain in a rapidly accessible state at one time. The term working is mean to indicate that mental work requires the use of such information. (p.1) (Cowan 2005) The term, like most concepts in science, does not have an exact definition, nor does it have a definitive method of measurement. While there is no universally recognized first use of the term, researchers began to postulate that there was some sort of system that mediated incoming sensory information with the world with the information in long term storage using modular models of memory in the mid-twentieth century. Summarized in (Cowan 2005), one of the first modal models of memory was proposed by (Broadbent 1958) and later expanded by (Atkinson and Shiffrin 1968). As seen in Figure 2.5 taken from Cowan (2005), both models here posit incoming information that is then put into some sort of limited capacity store. These modal models were then expanded on by Baddeley and Hitch (Baddeley and Hitch 1974) in their 1974 chapter with the name Working Memory, where they proposed a system with an central executive module that was able to carry out active maintenance and rehearsal of information that could be stored in either a phonological store for sounds or a visual sketchpad for images. Figure 2.5: Schematics of Models of Working Memory taken from Cowan, 2005 Later revisions of their model also incorporated an episodic buffer (Baddeley 2000) where the modules were explicitly depicted as being able to interface with long term memory in the rehearsal processes. The model has even been expanded upon by other researchers throughout its lifetime. The most relevant to this study is by Berz (1995), who postulated the addition of a musical rehearsal loop to the already established phonological loop and visual spatial sketchpad. While Berz is most likely correct in asserting that the nature of storing and processing musical information is different to that of words or pictures and there has been experimental evidence to suggest this (Williamson, Baddeley, and Hitch 2010) that has been interpreted in favor of multiple loops (Wöllner and Halpern 2016), it does introduce the theoretical problem of determining how any why incoming sensory information is partitioned into the respective loops. Additionally, models that assert some sort of Central Executive component to attend to materials held in a sensory buffer also face the infinite regress homonculus problem. Stated more clearly, if the Central Executive system is what attends to information in the sensory buffers, what attends to the Central Exeutive? In addressing the problem of explicitly stating which rehearsal loops do and do not exist, Nelson Cowan proposed a separate model (Cowan 1988, 2005) dubbed the Embedded Process Model which do not claim the existence of any domain specific module (e.g. positing a phonological loop, visual spatial sketchpad) but is rather based on an exhaustive model that did away with the problem of asserting specific buffers for specific types of information. In Cowan’s own words comparing his model from that of Baddeley Hitch model: The aim was to see if the description of the processing structure could be exhaustive, even if not complete, in detail. By analogy, consider two descriptions of a house that has not been explored completely. Perhaps it has only been examined from the outside. Baddeley’s (1986) approach to modeling can be compared with hypothesizing that there is a kitchen, a bathroom, two equal-size square bedrooms, and a living room. This is not a bad guess, but it does not rule out the possibllity that there actually are extra bedrooms or bathroom, that the bedroom space is apportioned into two rooms very different in size, or that other rooms exist in the house. Cowan’s (1988) apporach, on the other hand, can be compared with hypothesizing that the house includes food preparating quarters, sleeping quarters, batroom/toilet quarters, and other living quarters. It is meant to be exhaustive in that nothing was left out, even though it is noncommital on the details of some of the rooms. p.42 Cowan, 2005. The system is depicted in the bottom tier of 2.5, and conceptualizes the limited amount of information that is readily available as being in the focus of attention, with activated sensory and categorical features of what is in the focus of attention to be accessible nearby. Moving further from the locus of attention is long term memory, whose content can be turned to by using the central executive to access non-immediately available information. The central exeutive system in this case acts as a spotlight on what is represented in long term memory, rather than a module used to direct attention to specific sensory information. In contrast to the modular approaches, Cowan’s framework does not require the researchers to specify exactly how and where each the incoming information is being stored which makes it advantageous for studying complex stimuli such as music and melodies. In addition to having multiple frameworks for studying working memory capacity, there is also the problem of limits to the working memory system, often referred to as the working memory capacity. Most popularized by Miller in his famous (Miller 1956) speech turned article, Miller suggests out of jest that the number 7 might be worth investigating, which has been used as a point of reference for many researchers since then. It is worth nothing that Miller has since gone on record as noting that using 7 (plus or minus 2) was a rhetorical device used to string together his speech (Miller 1989). Nevertheless, while the number seven is most likely a red herring, it did inspire a large amount of research on capacity limits. In the decades since the number 7 has been reduced to about 4 (Cowan 2010) and research around capacity limits has been investigated using a variety of novel tasks, most noteable the complex span task (Unsworth et al. 2005, 2009). When used as predictors in both higher and lower cognitive tasks, measures of working memory capacity predict performance well and additionally tend to be stable across a lifetime (Unsworth et al. 2005). 2.2.1.1 Parallels Between Working Memory and Melodic Dictation Given its predictive strength as well as its direct similarity to tasks of melodic dictation, an in depth look at the literature is warranted. Clearly an individual’s ability to take in sensory information, maintain it in memory, actively carry out other tasks (like notating a melody) are almost identical to tasks of working memory capacity. Before venturing onward from this striking parallel, tasks investigating working memory capacity differ from melodic dictation tasks in a few key ways. The first is that musical information is always sequential: a melodic dictation task would never require the student to recall the pitches back in scrambled orders. Serial order recall is an important characteristic in the scoring and analyzing of working memory tasks (Conway et al. 2005), but musical tones do not appear in random order and are normally in discernable chunks as discussed by Karpinski (Karpinski 2000). The use of chunks is pervasive in much of the memory literature, but often is used as more of a heuristic to help explain that information in the environment and why it is often grouped together. Of the problems with chunking, most are related to music and have relevance to melodic dictation. Below I review the problems with chunking noted by Cowan (Cowan 2005), and any pertitant music psychology literature. Chunks may have a hierarchical organization. Tonal music has historically been understood to be hierarchical (Krumhansl 2001; Meyer 1956; Schenker 1935) with the study for memory for tones being confounded by some pitches being undestood by their relation to structurally more stable tones. The working memory load may be reduced as working memory shifts between levels in hierarchy. If an individual understands a chunk to be something such as a major triad, the load on working memory would be less since it that information could be understood as a singular chunk. Chunks may be the endpoints of a continuum of associations. Given tonal music’s sequential and statistical properties, two tones might be able to be loosely associated given a context which would make the tones fall between being identified as two tones and one distinct chunk. Chunks may include asymmetrical information. More tonal possibilities are possible from a stable note like tonic or dominant, whereas in a tonal context, a raised scale degree #\\(\\hat{4}\\) when understood in a functional context would be taken as having stricter transitional probabilities (#\\(\\hat{4} \\rightarrow \\hat{5}\\)). There may be a complex network of associations. If a set of pitches sounds like a similar set of pitches from long term memory , the information coming in cannot be understood as being separate units of working memory. Chunks may increase in size rapidly over time. Three tones that are seemingly unrelated when incoming like E4, G5, C5 might enter sensory perception as three different tones, but then be fused together when they are understood as one chunk– a first inverstion major triad. Information in working memory may benefit from rapid storage in long term memory. Given the amount of patterns that an individual learns and can understand, as soon as something is fused, it could be encoded in long term memory, especially if there is a salient feature in the incoming melodic information such as the immediate recognition of a mode or cadence. The points by Cowan are important to acknowledge in that it is not possible to directly lift work and paradigms from working memory capcacity to work in music perception. That said, the enormous amount of theoretical frameworks put forward by the working memory liteature when understood in conjunction with theories in music psychology such as implicit statistical learning (Saffran et al. 1999) can provide for new, fruitul theories. Past reserachers have noted the strength and predictive abilities from the working memory capacity literature as aiding research in music perception. In ending his article positing a musical memory loop to be annexed to the Baddley and Hitch modular model of working memory, Berz (Berz 1995) captures the power of this concept in the last sentence of his article and warns future reserachers that Individual differences portrayed in some music aptitude tests may [sic] represent not talent or musical intelligence but ability, reflecting differences in working memory capacity. p. 362 Berz’s assertion has not been exhausivly tested since first published in 1995, but the subject of music, memory, and cognitive abilities has been the focus of research of both psychologists and musicologists alike. Below I survey literature bordering on both music, as well as cognitive abiltity. 2.2.1.2 Working Memory Capacity and Music Of the papers in the music science literature that specifically investigates working memory, each uses different measures, though but all tend to converge on two general findings. The first is that there are some sort of enhanced memory capabilities in individuals with musical training. The second is that working memory capacity, however it is measured, often plays a significant role in musical tasks. Evidence for the first point appears most convincingly in a recent meta analyses by Talamini and colleagues (Talamini et al. 2017) who demonstrated via three separate meta-analyses that musicians outperform their non-musical counterparts on tasks dealing with long-term memory, short-term memory, as well as working memory. The authors also noted that the effects were the strongest in working memory tasks where the stimuli were tonal, which again suggests an advantage of exposure and understanding of the hierarchical organization of musical materials. In this meta-analyss and others investigating music and cognitive ability, it is important to be reminded that the direction of causality still from these studies cannot be determined using these statistical methodologies. While it might seem that musical training tends to lead to these increases, it is also possible that higher functioning individuals will self select into musical activities. Even if there is no seletion bias in engaging with musical activity it also remains a possiblity that of the people that do engage with musical activity, the higher functioning individuals will be less likely to quit over a lifetime. In terms of musical performance abilities, working memory capacity has also been shown to be a significant predictor. Kopiez and Lee suggested that working memory capacity should to contribute to sight reading tasks based on research where they found measures of working memory capacity, as measured by a matrix span task, to significantly correlated with many of their measures hypothesized to be related to sight reading ability in pianists at lower difficulty grading (Kopiez and Lee 2006, 2008). Following up on this work on sight reading, Meinz and Hambrick (Meinz and Hambrick 2010) found that working memory capacity, as measured by an operation span task, a reading span task, rotation span task, and a matrix span task was able to predict a small amount of variance \\(R^2=.074(0.067)\\) above and beyond that of deliberate practice alone \\(R^2=.451(.441)\\) in a sight-reading task. More recently, two studies looking at specific sub-groups of musicians have shown working memory capacity to significantly contribute to models of performances on musical tasks related to novel stimuli. Wöllner and Halpern (2016) found that although no differences were found between pianists and conductors in measures of working memory capacity as measured via a set of span tasks, conductors showed superior performance in their attention flexibility. Following up on this line of research Nichols, Wöllner, and Halpern (2018) used the same battery of working memory tasks and found that jazz musicians excelled over their classically trained counterparts in a task which required them to hear notes and reproduce them on the piano. The authors also noted that of their working memory battery, based on standard operation span methods (Engle 2002), that the auditory dictation condition scored surprisingly low and further research might consider further work on dictation abilities. Additionally, Colley, Keller, and Halpern (2018) found that working memory capacity, as measured by a backwards digit span and operation span, to be successful predictors in a tapping task requiring sensory motor prediction abilities. As mentioned above, each of these tasks where working memory was a significant predictor of performance occured where the task involved active enagement with novel musical material. The growing evidence in this field suggests that the advantage of working memory capacity to be greatest in both musically trained people, dealing with novel information, using tonal materials. Since all three of these factors are related to melodic dictation, it would seem sensible to continue to include these measures in tasks of musical perception and continue Berz’s assertion that research in music percetion could inadvertently be picking up on individual differences in working memory abilities. As discussed above, the idea of IQ or intelligence has a long and complex history. When used as a predictor in statistical models, it often serves to predict traits that society values like longevity and general income so given its ability to predict in more domain general settings, surveying literature where it applies to musical activity warrents attention. Below I use the term intelligence as a catch all term to avoid the historical context of IQ and specify where availible which measure was actually used. Before surveying the literature here it is also worth noting that reserach on music and intelligence is not as developed as some of the larger studies looking at intelligence which provides problems for both establishing causal directionality, as well as controlling for other factors like self theories of ability, socioeconomic status, and personality (Müllensiefen et al. 2015). As reviewed in Schellenberg (2017), both children and adults who engage in musical activity tend to score higher on general measurses of intelligence than their non-musical peers (Gibson, Folley, and Park 2009; Hille et al. 2011; Schellenberg 2011; Schellenberg and Mankarious 2012) with the duration of training sharing a relationship with the extent of the increases in IQ (Corrigall and Schellenberg 2015; Degé, Kubicek, and Schwarzer 2011; Schellenberg 2006). Though many of these studies are correlational, they also have made attempts to control for confounding variables like socio-economic status and parental involvment in out of school activities (Corrigall and Trainor 2011; Degé, Kubicek, and Schwarzer 2011; Schellenberg 2011; Schellenberg and Mankarious 2012) Schellenberg notes the problem of smaller sample sizes in his review (Corrigall and Trainor 2011; Parbery-Clark et al. 2011; Strait et al. 2012) in that studies that are typically smaller do not reach statistical significance. Schellenberg also references evidence that when professional musicians are matched with non-musicians from the general population there do not seem to be these associations (Schellenberg 2006). His review suggests the current state of the literature points to support the hypothesis that higher functioning kids that take music lessons and they tend to stay in lessons longer. Additionally, Schellenberg remains skeptical of any sorts of causal factors regarding increases in IQ (Francois et al. 2013; Moreno et al. 2009) noting methodlogical problems like how short exposure times were in studies claiming increases in effects or researchers who not holding pre-exisiting cognitive abilitis constant (Mehr et al. 2013). Continued work by Swaminithan, Schellenberg, and Khalil continue to support evidence for this selection bias in training resulting in higher cognitive abilities among musicians (Swaminathan, Schellenberg, and Khalil 2017). 2.2.2 Environmental Standing in contrast to factors that individuals do not have a much control over such as the size of their working memory capacity or factors related to their general fluid intelligence, most of the factors music pedagogues believe contribute to someone’s ability to take melodic dictation are related to what I have put foward as environment factors. In fact, one of the tacit assumptions of any formal education revolves around the belief that with deliberate and attentive practice, that an individual is able to move from novice status to some level of expertise in their chosen domain. The idea that time invested results in beneficial returns is probably best formalized by work produced by Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Romer (1993) that suggests that performance at more elite levels results from deliberate practice. As noted in studies above such as Meinz and Hambrick (2010), deliberate practice is is able to explain variance in task performance, but again other research suggests more variables are at play. Detterman and Ruthsatz (1999) propose that three factors, general intelligence, domain specific ability, and practice are the cornerstones of developing expertise in music. The first of their three is not malliable, while the former two are presumed to be plastic. This reasoning has been explored by researchers such as Ruthsatz et al. (2008), who investigated these assertions and provided empirical evidence to support this notion using a hierarchial multiple regression modelling and concluded that each of these variables does in fact contribute significantly to the target variable of musical performance. Other researchers have since commented on these expertise modelslike Mosing et al. (2014) who have asserted that a genetic component, rather than those listed above best explain variance on musical ability. One major problem with interpreting literature like the studies mentioned above is the general lack of agreement on what constitutes musical behaviors. At a very high level, many of the aforementioned studies take a parochial view of what it means to engage in musical activity, a problem which is only exacerbated by not having uniform psychometric measurments (Baker et al. 2018; Talamini et al. 2017). Interpreting this data then becomes difficult as what it means to be profeccient at a muscial task is culturally dependent. Investigating musical talent as if were a universal is a problem well documented in both the ethnomusicological and music edudcation literaure (Blacking 2000; Murphy 1999). 2.2.3 Aural Training In additon to individuals differing in their general musical abilities– however they are defined– individuals also differ in their abilities at the level of their aural skills. The same problems that arise in operationalizing musicianship are apparent in defining aural skills. Reviewing the literature, I take aural skills to encompass the many skills often taught in music school, not resticting those skills to any particular sets of exercies. Some researchers like Chenttee (Chenette 2019) have taken stricter defintions attempting to state only skills that engage working memory capaicty are those that are truly aural, but this operizationalizaiton would limit this review’s scope. Though not as heavily researched in the past few decades (Furby 2016), there has been specific research looking at modeling how individuals perform in aural skills examinatons. Harrison, Asmus, and Serpe (1994) examined the effect of aural skills training on undergraduate students by creating a latent variable model investigating musical aptitude, academic ability, musical expertise, and motivation to study music in a sample of 142 undergraduate students and claimed to be able to explain 73% of the variance in aural skills abilities using the variables measured. Work from Colin Wright’s dissertation took a mixed methods approach investigating correlations between aural ability and their degree sucess as well as interviewing university students regarding their the importance of aural skills educaiton. In his work he found a general positive correlation between aural ability and measures of degree success. While results are still mixed regarding how best to measure and asses this ability, the near ubiquity of aural skills education has resulted in many investigations of how people might improve their ability. As noted in Furby (2016), researchers in the past have suggested a variety of techniques for improving their abilities in melodic dictation by isolating rhythm and melody (Banton 1995; Bland 1984; Root 1931), listening attentively to the melody before writing (Banton 1995), recognizing patterns (Banton 1995; Bland 1984; Root 1931) and silently vocalizing while dictating (Klonoski 2006). Interpreting a clear best path forward from these studies again remains difficult due to the sheer amount of variables at play. Often described as the other side of the same coin of melodic dictation, sight singing is an area of music pedagogy research that has recieved some attention, yet probably not the extent is deserved given its prevelance in school of music curricula. Recently Fournier et al. (2017) catalouged and categorized 14 different strategies that students used when learning to sight read. The authors orgnized their 14 categories into four larger main categories and suggested that aural skills pedagoges should employ their framework in their aural skills pedagogy. Similar to commentaries in literature on melodic dictation, Fournier et al. (2017) also note a line of research that has documented that university students are often unprepared to sight-read single lines of music (Asmus 2004; Thompson 2003) even though it is, like dictation, thought of as a means for deeper musical understanding (Karpinski 2000; Rogers 2004). Fournier et al. (2017) also note that sight-reading has been an active area of research due to the often reported relationship that performance on sight reading often predicts several studies have shown links between academic success in sight-singing and predictors such as entrance tests (???), academic ability, and musical experience (Harrison, Asmus, and Serpe 1994). Taken as a whole, the research tends to suggesting that learning to be a fluid and compotent sight reader helps musicians hone their skills by bootstrapping other musical skills since the skills needed for sightreading touch on many of the skills used in musical performance like pattern matching and listening for small changes in intonnation. While the above literature suggests there are empirical grounds to consider these individual factors in predicting how well an individual will do in melodic dictation, these factors will invariably interact with the other half of the taxonomy: the musical parameters. 2.3 Musical Parameters Transitioning to the other half of the taxonomy on figure 2.4, the other main source of variance in any study investigating melodic perception is the effect of the melody itself. I find it safe to assume that not all melodies are equally difficult to dictate and assert that variance in the difficulty the melody can partitioned between both structural and experimental aspects of a melody. As noted above, there is not a strict deliniation between these two categories since once could imagine drastic maniuplations in experimental parameters in order to result in a phenomenologically different experience of melody. Questions of transformations of melodies and musical similarity fall have been addressed in other research (Cambouropoulos 2009; Wiggins 2007) but are beyond the scope of this study. 2.3.1 Structural JUST WRITE ENOUGH TO DO MELODIC DICTATION The assumption that music as represented by a score is able to provide insights towards understanding the music is a core tennents of music theory and analysis. Throughout the 20th Century, music theorists have almost exclusively relied on musical scores as their central point of reference in their work. According to Clarke, this structuralist approach to music comes form Dalhaus. Score based orthodoxy is reflected in tools, imagine schenker ald the like. And if you’re a humanist, as Aawu agues, this is once thing you bring to the table. Like Dahlhaus, Chua (1999) argues that the idea of absolute music was an invention of the early nineteenth century, and that along with its absoluteness came claims for its ineffability. If absolute music consists of abstract structural units, then it must either have no meaning, or else a meaning that is similarly abstract, absolute, and intangible. And if musical meaning is abstract, absolute, and ineffable then it is only a very short step to claims of universality and mystery, and thus to the quasi-religious character of nineteenth and twentieth century concert listening practices, documented by Johnson () in his history of listening in Paris. This structralist approach to music CLARKE Assumption of score to representaiton this is done in theory This is done by meyer This is done with everyone else. Many ways talking about music, however it is represented, and meaning is big part of what we do as analysts AGAWU. Where some branches of music theory look at what huron refers to as Finite data, others generally stemming from the european systematich musicology and those interested in Meyer are different. Not exclusive to this world of thought, even before Free Comp, Ortamann talked about melodic determiants. Heinrich Schenker argued for an undertanding of tonal music (Schenker 1935) that asserted hierarchical relationships of notes on the musical surface in the early 20th century and work eminating from this line of thought laid much of the ground work of music analysis. Work from Schenkerian thinking has since been expanded upon by theorists over the past century from Saltzer (???), to Schacter and colleagues (???; ???). One of the core assumptions of Schenkerian analysis is that the compositional reductions realized through analyses are perceptually salient to the listener given. Leonard Meyer– in his Emotion and Meaning in Music (Meyer 1956) –continued many of these lines of thought and forward the notion that tethered the struture that earlier theorists wrote about to this struture being fundamental to the perception of the piece that there were also responsible for some aspects of the emotion and meaning listeners found in music. Meyer’s work since inspired a line of reserach investigating the perception of the structural aspects of music could be understood with the work of Eugene Narmor (Narmour 1990, 1992), Glenn Schellenberg (Schellenberg 1997), Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis (Margulis 2005), David Huron (Huron 2006) and have inpsired computational, machine learning approaches to expectational frameworks in with work by Marcus Pearce (Pearce and Wiggins 2012). WHAT IS THE POINT OF ALL THIS RESERACH SETNECE These general models of melodic perception tend suggest that Meyer was correct in his assertion that computational methodologies could be used to better understand question of melodic perception and strucuture and that there are links between the structure of the music and its perception.4 Turning to studies examining melodic dictation with a focus on musical structure, the first study to examine it extensively was Ortmann in 1933 (Ortmann 1933). Ortamnn used a series of twenty five-note melodies in order to examine the effects of repetition, pitch direction, conjunct-disjunct motion (contour), interval size, order, and chord structure, all of which he deems to be the determinants of an individual’s ability to dictate melodic material. Though Ortmann did not use any statistical methods to model his data, he did assert that each of his determinants contributed to an individual’s ability to dictate musical material. This work was extended by (Taylor and Pembrook 1983) which additionally incoporated using musical skill as a predictor and additionally found evidence that these factors contributed to individual dictation abilities in a sample of 122 undergraduate students. Although the literature is generally sparce compared to other areas of music cognition, literature exploring the effects of structural characteristics on memory does exist. Long found that length, tonal structure, contour, and individual traits all contribute to performance on melodic dictation examinations and found that structure and tonalness to have significant, albeit small predictive powers in modeling (Long 1977). One problem with studies such as (Long 1977) is that they sometimes would make conspicuous methodloogical decisions such as elimnating individuals who were bad singers for the example. Not only does this reduce the spectrum of ability levels (assuming that singing ability correlates with dictation ability, a finding since which has been established (Norris 2003)), but is additinally flawed in that it is at odds both with the intuition that an individual’s singing ability cannot be taken as a direct representation of their mental image of the melody and is probably more related to the ability to have motor control over the vocal tract (Pfordresher and Brown 2007). Other researchers have also put forward other paramters thought to contribute like tempo (Hofstetter 1981) tonality (Dowling 1978; Long 1977) (Pembrook 1986) (Oura and Hatano 1988) interval motion (Ortmann 1933; Pembrook 1986) length of melody (Long 1977; Pembrook 1986) number of presentations (Hofstetter 1981) [(Pembrook 1986)] context of presentation (Schellenberg and Moore 1985) listener experience (Long 1977; Oura and Hatano 1988) (Schellenberg and Moore 1985; Taylor and Pembrook 1983) familarity of style (Schellenberg and Moore 1985) Pembrook (1986) provides an extensive detailing of a systematic study to melodic dictation where they used tonality, melody length, and type of motion as variables in their experiment. They additionally also restricted their experimental melodies to those that were singable. The authors found all three variables to be significant predictors with tonality explaining 13% of the variance, length explaining 3% of the variance and type of motion explaining 1% of the variance. The paper also claims that people on average can hear and remember 10-16 notes, which is worth commenting that these 10–16 notes are dependent on the experimental context of the melodies played with the quarter note set to 90 beats per minute. Given the lack of consistent methodlogies in adminstration and scoring of these experiments it becomes difficult to find ways to generalize basic findings like expected effect sizes– especially when the original materials and data have not been recorded– but there is often interesting theoretical insights to be gleaned. For example (Oura 1991) used a sample of eight people to suggest that when taking melodic dictation, individuals use a system of pattern matching that interfaces with their long term memory in order to complete dictation tasks. While this paper does not bring with it exhaustive evidence supporting this claim, the idea is explored in detail in Chapter 6 the idea of pattern matching is used in conjunction with Cowan’s embeded process model of working memory. More recently the music education community has also began to do research around melodic dictation using both qualitative and quantitiatve methdologies. (Paney and Buonviri 2014) interviewed high school teachers on methods they used to teach melodic dictation and (Gillespie 2001) has done work on investigating methods as to best score melodic dictation. Other work by (Pembrook and Riggins 1990) surveyed various methodlogies used by instructurs in aural skills settings. Some of these studies consider aural skills as a totality like (Norris 2003) who provided quantiative evidence to suggest most aural skills pedagoge’s intuition that there is some sort of relationship between melodic dictation and sight singing. Looking at the notorious subset of students with absolute pitch (AP), (Dooley and Deutsch 2010) provided evidence demonstrated that students with AP tend to outperform their non-AP colleagues in tests of dication. [SOME OF THESE ARE CLEARLY EXPERIMENTAL AND NEED TO BE PUT THERE] Continuing exploring the pedagogical liteature, Naton Buonviri and colleagues have also made melodic dictation a central focus of some recent papers. Paney and Buonviri (2014) interviewed high school teachers on methods that they used to teach melodic dictation. N. Buonviri (2015) interviewed six sophomore music majors to find sucessful strategies that students enaged with when completing melodic dications. Paney (2016) reported beneficial effects to direct student’s attention and guide them through melodic dictation exercises suggesting that some sort of mental organizaton of the dication process is helpful. N. O. Buonviri and Paney (2015) found that having students sing a preparatory singing pattern after hearing the target melody, essentially a distractor task, hindered performance on melodic dictation. Buonviri (2015)… N. Buonviri (2015) found no effects of test presentation format (visual versus aural-visual) using a melodic memory paradigm. Buonviri (2017) reported no significant advatage to listening strategies while partaking in a melodic dictation test. 2.3.1.1 Recent Computational Musicology Work papers and findings Using symbolic features of the melodies themselves is not a novel approach as noted in the above literature attempting to predict performance on melodic dictations. Much of this work pre-dates recent advances in computational musicology such as the advent of technology like David Huron’s Humdrum (Huron 1994) and Michael Cutberth’s Music21 (Cuthbert and Ariza 2010) which now allows music researchers to systematically digitize symbolic musical material. In addition to creating accesible frameworks for encoding, the computational power availble exponentially exceeds that of what was availble in the 20th century and has opened up new possibilities in the computational modeling of music. While I reserve a longer discussion on the histories of computational musicology for the fourth chapter, relevant to this study is the additional ways it is now possible to abstract features from symbolic melodies beyond what was capable in studies such as Ortmann (1933) and Taylor and Pembrook (1983). An abstracted feature of a melody is an emergent property of the melody that results from performing some sort of calculation on the melody? This type of feature abstraction is in contrast to much of the work done in the field of music information retrivial which often relies on the recorded audio for feature abstraction and is addressed under Experimental features LINK THAT IN!. Abstracted symbolic features of melodies can largely be conceptualized as being static or dynamic. The above papers tended to use more simplisitc methods of figuring out parameters such as counting the notes by hand but with the advent of new encoding systems and more powerful computing power it is now possible to take on much more rigerious computational analyses. 2.3.1.2 Static Views of Computational Features/ FANTASTIC Static features of melodies work by summerizing some aspect of the melody as if it were to be experience in suspended animation. Using static features helps quantify something that might be intuitive about a melody or piece of encoded music. For example, something like David Huron’s contour class used in a study investigating melodic arches (Huron 1996) using the Essen Folk Song Collection (Schaffrath 1995) can only be understood as a feature of the melody itself once the melody has been sounded and is recalled would be a static feature of a melody. Other examples include a melody’s global note density, normalized pairwise variability index (CITATION), and a melody’s tonalness as calculated by one of the various key profile algorithms (KRUMHANSL,ALBRECT AND SHANAHAN) These measures are useful when describing melodies and are predictive of various behavioral phenomena as detailed below, but at this point it has not been well established to what degree these summary features can be directly related to aspects of human behavior. The quintessential and most comprehensive toolbox example of this is Daniel Müllensiefen’s Feature ANalysis Technology Accesing STatistics (In a Corpus) or FANTASTIC (Mullensiefen 2009). FANTASTIC is software that is capable summerizing musical material at for monophonic melodies. In additon to computing 37 features such as contour variation, tonalnesss, note density, note length, and measures inspired by computational linguistics (THAT BOOK OF GERAINT), FANTASTIC also calculates m-types (melodic-rhyhmic motives) that are based on the frequency distributions of melodic segements found genres of music. This is inspired by fact that repeition is key structure of music (Huron 2006) Work using the FANTASTIC toolboox has been sucessful in predicting court case decisions (Müllensiefen and Pendzich 2009), predicting chart sucesses of songs on the Beatles’ Revolver (Kopiez and Mullensiefen 2011), memory for old and new melodies in signal detection experiments (Müllensiefen and Halpern 2014), memory for earworms (Jakubowski et al. 2017; Williamson and Müllensiefen 2012), memorability of pop music hook (Balen, Burgoyne, and Bountouridis 2015). In experimental studies, FANTASTIC has also been used to determine item difficulty (Baker and Müllensiefen 2017; Harrison, Musil, and Müllensiefen 2016) and has even been the basis of the development of a computer assistted platform for studying memory for melodies (Rainsford, Palmer, and Paine 2018). 2.3.1.3 Dynamic In addition to using summary based features on melodies, it is also possible to model the perception of musical materials by using a dynamic approach that is dependent on the unfolding of musical material. First explored in CONKLIN, and then first published as a dynamic model of expectation in his doctoral dissertation, Marcus Pearce’s Informaton Dynamics Of Melody IDyOM models musical expectancy using various information theoretic concepts inspired by Claude Shannon (SHANNON). The model takes an unsupervised machine learning approach and calculates the information content of the amount of DECLARED n-grams in the corpus. As a model exploring expection for melody IDyOM has has been applied to a variety of settings LIST THEM HERE. The domain general application of IDyOM has given creedence to Meyer’s assertion that the enculturation of musical styles stems from statistical exposure to melodies and be somewhat refelective of the cogitive processes used in muscical perception. IDyOM has also been recently extended to look at expectation in multi-part chorales (SAUVE WORK) and expectations of harmony (HARRISON WORK). (Pearce and Wiggins 2012) The advantage of using a dynamic approach is that it theoretically reflects real-time perception of music with the structural characeristics of the music mapping on to real human behavior. 2.3.2 Experimental Advantage of vocal melodies paper | Weiss 2015 Voice is better than instruments Weiss Trehub Schellenberg 2012 Engaging, conspecific signal Weiss Peretz 2019 , not due to expressivity. even see this in amusics. Not affected by musical training or exposure MIR stuff Stuff out of education stuff that is also experimental WM W LVH, two span tasks and claim it effects langauge tasks WM Halpern 2017 with pearce, LTM stuff , re look this up 2.4 Modeling and Polymorphism of Ability Given the current state of cognitive psychology and psychometrics, as well as recent advances in computational musicology, the possibilities for now operationalizing and then modeling aspects of melodic dictation are as advanced as they ever have been. Given that we can now assign numbers to basically every factor that is thought to contribute to this process from concepts of musicianship, to features of a melody, to the variable size in an individual’s working memory capacity all of these thigns can be put into some sort of model. While this will bring the community closer to formally modeling all of this and lead to a clearer understanding, before going ahead and doing this it is worth pointing out that many of the concepts discussed above are highly complex concepts like musicianship and tonalness and rest on lots of assumptions. Musicianship, for example, or any measure of musical training is not something that can be measured directly such as a person’s height or weight, but has to be inferred based on the logical assumptions of the person doing the measurments. So while the rest of this study will rely on this, it is important to note that people shouldn’t confuse abstracted concepts with real things. The most illustrative example of this comes from a study by HARRISON ET AL who created a latent variable model of aural skills that was able to predict 74% of the variance in aural skills performance. This latent trait that the authors created may be helpful in explaining the patterns of covariance in data, but this would be to reifiy a statistical abstraction as an ontologically true idea. This idea has been discussed before critqiuing ideas such as g (Gould 1996; Kovacs and Conway 2016) and has recently been the subject of critique in music psychology OUR GOLDMSI PAPER. The same arguments put forward in this literature also are relevant here. In order to have a complete, causal model of how melodic dictation works, it is important to understand melodic dictation as a set of musical abilities that are related to other musical abilities, though may not be related. This idea is not new even in music psychology, the past two decades have seen calls for a more polymorphic definition of musical ability (Levitin 2012; Peretz and Coltheart 2003) which in its modeling will require more concrete ways of defining how it works than just correlating variable together that are helpful at prediction without saying exactly how that process happens. 2.5 Conclusions In this chapter I first described what is melodic dictation using Karpinki’s model of melodic dictation, noted what the things were that were missing from this model as a stepping off point, then went on to suggest a taxonomy of these based on what already has done. I suggest there are both individual as well as musical features that need to be understood in order to have a comprensive understanding of melodic dictation. Of the two sets of features, individual features can be either cognitive or environmental and musical features can be either structural or experimental. This taxonomy does not consist of exclusive categories and certainly permits interactions between any and all of the levels. It would be impossible given the scope of this study to effectively quantify each and every factor and how it interacts at every level, but the degree to which there is the most literature and you can get the most bang for you buck seems like the obvious stepping off point. Rest of this dissertation will systehsize these areas and put forth novel research contributing to the modeling and subsequent understanding of melodic dictation. Understanding melodic dictation will help with both understanding melodic perception and help our pedagogy. 2.5.1 Add In (Hansen, Wallentin, and Vuust 2013) Dowling 1991 (Dowling 1991) References "]
