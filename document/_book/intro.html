<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> What is melodic dictation? and Why?</h2>
<p>Melodic dictation is the process in which an individual hears a melody, retains it in memory, and then uses their knowledge of Western musical notation to recreate the mental image of it on paper in a limited time frame.
For many, becoming proficient at this task is at the core of developing one’s aural skills <span class="citation">(Karpinski <a href="#ref-karpinskiModelMusicPerception1990">1990</a>)</span>.
For over a century, music pedagogues have highly valued melodic dictation<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and most aural skills texts that have sections devoted to honing one’s listening skills have material on melodic dictation <span class="citation">(Karpinski <a href="#ref-karpinskiAuralSkillsAcquisition2000">2000</a>)</span>.
Additionally, any school accredited by the National Associatoin of Schools of Music in North American requires learning this skill be part of any accredited curricula as listed under Section VIII.6.B.2.A.</p>
<div id="small-tirade-could-put-this-at-end" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Small Tirade, could put this at end?</h3>
<p>Yet despite this tradition and ubiquity, the rationales as to <em>why</em> it is important for students to learn this ability often comes from some sort of appeal to tradition or underwhelming anecdotal evidence that time spent learning to take melodic dictation results in increases in near transfer abilities after they have acquired a certain degree of proficiency.
Rationales given for why students should learn melodic dictation has even been described by Gary Karpinski as being based on “comparatively vague aphorisms about mental relationships and intelligent listening” <span class="citation">(Karpinski <a href="#ref-karpinskiModelMusicPerception1990">1990</a>, 192)</span>, with the argument for learning to take melodic dictation historically not being well supported with persuasive evidence.</p>
<p>Some researchers have even taken a more skeptical stance and have noted that the rationale for why we teach melodic dictation deserves more critique.
For example, Klonoski in writing about aural skills education aptly questions “What specific deficiency is revelaned with an incorrect response in melodic dictation settings?” <span class="citation">(Klonoski <a href="#ref-klonoskiImprovingDictationAuralSkills2006">2006</a>)</span>.
Earlier researchers like Potter, in their own publication, have noted that they have been baffled that many musicians do not actually keep up with their melodic dictation abilities after the class ends <span class="citation">(Potter <a href="#ref-potterIdentifyingSucessfulDictation1990">1990</a>)</span>, but presumably go on to have successful and fulfilling musical lives.
Additionally, suggesting that people who can hear music and then are unable to write it down, and thus are unable to think <em>in</em> music, seems somewhat exclusionary to the vast amount of musical cultures out there that do not depend on any sort of written notation.</p>
<p>Though despite this skepticism towards the topic, melodic dictation remains at the forefront of many aural skills classrooms.
While the act of becoming better at this skill may or may not lead to large in increases in far transfer of ability, as a pedagogical tool, teaching students to take melodic dictation brings with it the concepts that are hoped to be instilled in music students long term.
While not there has not been extensive research on melodic dictation research in the past few years, in fact <span class="citation">(Paney <a href="#ref-paneyEffectDirectingAttention2016">2016</a>)</span> notes that since 2000, only four studies were published that directly examined melodic dictation, this skill set sits on the border between literature on learning, melodic perception, memory, and music theory pedagogy and understanding and modeling exactly how it works remains as a untapped watershed of knowledge for the field of music theory, music education, and music perception and is deserving of much more attention.</p>
</div>
<div id="describing-melodic-dictation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Describing Melodic Dictation</h3>
<p>Much of the foundational work on the topic of melodic dictation comes from the work of Gary Karpinski.
Summarized most recently in his <em>Aural Skills Acquisition</em> <span class="citation">(Karpinski <a href="#ref-karpinskiAuralSkillsAcquisition2000">2000</a>)</span>, though first presented in an earlier article <span class="citation">(Karpinski <a href="#ref-karpinskiModelMusicPerception1990">1990</a>)</span>, Karpinski proposes his own model of melodic dictation that provides a four step framework as how the process of melodic dictation works.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>His four steps include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Hearing</li>
<li>Short Term Melodic Memory</li>
<li>Musical Understanding</li>
<li>Notation</li>
</ol>
<p>and occur as a looping, schematic process that is depicted in Figure 3.1 in his textbook, reproduced below and throughout the chapter Karpinski discusses relevant factors at play at each stage.
In the case of the table above, the process happens twice, presumably with a melody that can be extracted in two parts, which according to Karpinski and this prescribed formulas would consist of a melody from twelve to twenty notes long for listeners with few or no chunking abilities.
Reviewing the Karpinksi four step model will provide both a grounding in the current model that has been used in other literature, and establish a groundwork from which to build.</p>
<p>The <strong>hearing</strong> stage involves the initial perceptions of the sound at a physical level of the tympanic membrane, as well as the listener’s <em>attention</em> to the incoming musical information.
If the listener is not actively engaging in the task because of factors like “boredom, lack of discipline, test anxiety, attention deficit disorder, or any number of other causes” then any further processes down the model will be detrimentally effected.
While Karpinski notes that these types of interference are normally “beyond the traditional jurisdiction of aural skills instruction”, I will later argue that the concept of willful attention when re-conceptualized as working memory capacity, may actually play a large role in the melodic dictation process.</p>
<p>The <strong>short-term melodic memory</strong> Karpinski relies on empirical qualitative evidence from interview with students to show support for two separate memory encoding mechanisms, one for contour, and one for pitch.
After citing literature supporting this claim (DOWLING 1978, DeWITT AND CROWDWER 1986, DOWLING 1994) regarding contour, as well as literature suggesting that in order to memorize chunks of melodic material, it helps to have been enculturated (DEUTSCH 1977,Oura and Hatano 1988, Handel 1989, Davies 1978, Dowling 1990) (a field of research that has been explored a lot since this was published PEARCE WORK), Karpinksi explains how ideas like extractive listening and chunking then take part in this process.
Noting that there is probably some sort of capacity limit to music, citing Miller (1956) and corroborating musical evidence (Marple n.d)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, Karpinski details the two strategies from above to show how the dictation process is done.
Karpinski’s extractive listening refers to only selectively remembering parts of a melody.
The chunking bit isa an idea that as musical understanding increases, so does musical memory.
The idea is that if you can identify certain ideas that you hear in the incoming signal, you can more effectively understand them.</p>
<p>In order to further explain the idea of <strong>musical understanding</strong> Karpinski says its different ha musical memory.
Musical memory for Karpinski is ability to repeat what has been heard, and understanding is about comprehending things like the hierarchical metrical relationships between notes, rhythmic groupings and tonal functions.
Within this whole idea is the thing of solimization for both rhythm and pitch (the takdimiti system KODALY) and relative pitch.
Idea here is that hte two are then going to be linked to one another and as information comes in that can be musically understood, then it can then be moved from perception to notation more quickly.</p>
<p>The <strong>notation</strong>, and final step of the dictation loop, require the knowledge of Western musical notation to be able to write down what is in one’s musical short term memory and use their musical understanding to decode that mental representation into written notation.
This last step is ripe for errors as Karpinski notes has been found in other areas of research TAYLOR AND PEMBROOK 1983 and its noted that obviously it’s very hard to write something down if you don’t have the category for it.</p>
<p>The final parts of the chapter, Karpinski notes that other factors like <strong>tempo</strong>, the <strong>length</strong> and <strong>number of playings</strong>, and the <strong>duration between playings</strong> will also play a role in determining how an individual will perform on a melodic dictation.
While this framework can help illuminate this cognitive process and help pedagogues understand how to best help their students, the model as it stands is not detailed enough for explanatory purposes and does not exhaust the many factors that further research since its publication have demonstrated as relevant making a model of melodic dictation.</p>
<p>Again, though Karpinski did not intent to create an exhaustive model of the melodic dictation process, by only creating a verbal model, the model is unprepared to handle a few basic things which are just the next logical research step.</p>
<p>From this point on, need tone to suggest that what Karpinski did is good, but the next step is to get more formal with it and be able to start investigating factors that go into doing melodic dictation beyond just a logical progression of steps.
From a resarch and education point of view it would would be good to know how the process works and in order to do that need to look at it as it happens with experimental approaches, and additionally want to try to make a model of it to make sure we include everything.</p>
<p>Title of is modeling melodic dictation, want to have model that describes it and its component parts, and want to have a model that describes the process.</p>
<p>In this literature review, I use the Karpinksi model as a stepping off point by first noting factors that presumably would contribute to this process that ohter people have looked at, organize them in a taxonomy, then review the relevant literature.
This is all done in hopes of furthering the fields understanding of melodic dictation and getting a hold of terms so that future research can attempt to be exhaustive in investigating this empirically, exntending the methods used to experimental and computtational methodologies.</p>
<p>Where the Karpinski model lacks, using as a scarecrow argument, is the amount of variablility at both the individual level, as well as at the musical level.</p>
<p>Primarily, having a single model for melodic dictation assumes that all individuals are likely to engage in this sequential ordering of events.
This could in fact be the case, but there is research ANDREW GOLDMAN AND STUFF that suggests that experts process and categorize musical information differently.
Additionally, different people will probably have different experiences dictating melodies based on their own past listening experience, a note that Karpinski makes earlier when THAT CITATION FROM UP ABOVE.
Not only will there be differences in ability, additionally people differ in their cognitive abilities.
The model does not have any flexibility in terms of individual differences.</p>
<p>Secondly, the model also does not seem to treat melodies differently.
For example, on page 103, Karpinski suggest that two passes should be adequate for a listen with few to no chunking skills to listen to be able to dictate a melody of twelve to twenty notes.
This also would be an area of model improvement, as both the melodies listed below here are XX notes, within Karpinski’s prescribed range, but intuition might suggest that the melodies are not equally difficult to dictate.
The model is agnostic towards differences in melodies.</p>
<p>In order to have a model that will eventually be able to incorporate everything involved in the melodic dictation process, and to be eventually implemented computationally, it is necessary to creates new taxonomy of factors that could contribute to modeling melodic dictation.
In the 18 years since the publication of <em>Aural Skills Acquisition</em>, there has been a wealth of research that has been done on factors related to melodic dictation.
I am convinced that the best way to taxonomize the multitude of factors contributing to this is to create a taxonomy where musical and individual factors are at the highest.
By creating a taxonomy of terms it will help organize research and provide a framework to think about how to best operationlize and study factors contributing ot modeling melodic dictation.</p>
<div id="individual-factors-to-contribute" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2.1</span> Individual Factors to contribute</h4>
<p>From an <strong>individual stand point</strong>, can bifurcate factors broadly into <em>cognitive factors</em>, or factors of people that are relatively consistent over people or basically like fixed effects things (use definition of what is a fixed effect); and the other side of this would be things that would have to be dealt with that change with training and exposure.
Going to refer to this second set of things as <em>environmental</em> factors.
Is there a better way to talk about this as nature vs nurture.
Additionally need to then mention that there are of course epigenitic factors where both of these parameters might interact with one another.
For example, might then imagine that someone with higher cognitive ability, lots of training that was put forward by their parents, as well as tons of musical training, and personality traits that are more likely to learn more (daniels paper on that) might be different in terms of results than someone with lower cognitive abilities, no training, low SES, and a general inclination not to even take music lessons.
While obvious, what will eventually be of interest is the degree to which each of these things contributes to the final models.
Also gives us a better idea about pedagogy and what not.</p>
</div>
<div id="musical-factors-to-contribute" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2.2</span> Musical factors to contribute</h4>
<p>In addition to differences at the individual level, there are also <strong>musical level</strong> characteristics.
In this category it is also worth taxonimizing the musical characteristics into two categories as well.
On one hand we have the <strong>structural aspects</strong> of the melody itself.
These are aspects of the melody that would remain invariant when written down on a score.
Reading from left to right, would be things like range, key, time signature, intervals, amount of notes, contour of the melody, tonal properties, standardized note density.
Then the other side would be musical features that I am going to deem as <strong>experimental features</strong> of the melody.
These are aspects of the structure of the melody that you can then warp within the context of a melodic dictation such as tempo, which then reflects note density, timbral qualities, how many times the melody is played, the space between hearings.
This is not a categorical divide, while I put something like range as key of the melody as structural, you could imagine that you could have the same interval invariant structure of a melody , perhaps Twinkle, Twinkle little star beginning on C2 notated in bass clef, but then imagine the the same “melody” being played two and a half octaves up on F#4, and transposed to minor and played quicker leading to a phenomenologically similar experience, but not the same.
I taxonimze them early on, but again note that a model of this should be able withstand the multitude of patterns that exist.</p>
</div>
<div id="make-a-model-of-them" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2.3</span> Make a Model of them</h4>
<p>Given all of these factors that then go into the melodic dictation process, the remainder of this chapter will detail previous research that has gone into each of these factors.
Talking about each one will provide rationale for why it should be further investigated if we are to better understand melodic dictation.
Beginning with <em>cognitive factors</em> two levels, then go on to talk about <em>musical features</em>.
After discussing both and their two subcompoents as I have taxonimzed them, offer a brief discussion on how it’s bad to think about these as just latent abilities.
Instead talk about thinking about modeling melodic dictation, in terms of ACTUAL MODELING, as polymorphic conceptualization of aural skills.
This is important because how we talk about and model things reflects or values and often it will get in the way of stuff.</p>
<p>This is important because the end goal of this research is to be able to model this from an experimental and computational level.</p>
<p>From an empirical standpoint, both the task as well as the process of melodic dictation as depicted by Karpinksi resemble something that can be turned into an experiment, as well as a computational model.
It’s basically an experiment where we have in person level predictors and melodies with different item level difficulty.
This dissertation seeks to explore the degree to which methodologies from cognitive psychology and computational musicology are able to further this literature and take the next logical step in terms of understanding aural skills.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Cognitive</h3>
<p>Research from the cognitive psychology literature suggests that individuals differ in their perpetual and cognitive abilities in ways that are not easily influenced by short term-training, are stable across a lifetime, and that these abilities, when investigated on a large scale, predict of a wealth of human behavior from longevity, to onset of Alzheimer’s disease, to the ability to deal with life stress events, and even the effects of alcohol consumption <span class="citation">(Ritchie <a href="#ref-ritchieIntelligenceAllThat2015">2015</a>; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="unsworthAutomatedVersionOperation2005"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.
Given the strength and generality of these predictors, it worth investigating the extent that these abilities might play when investigating modeling melodic dictation.
This is also important to understand because if we were to find out that something as simple as general fluid intelligence was a strong predictor in musical tasks that we are grading people on, it would be pretty unfair to do since we are then basically grading people on genetic factors beyond their control, as well as environmental factors shown to have some sort of effect on IQ <span class="citation">(Ritchie <a href="#ref-ritchieIntelligenceAllThat2015">2015</a>)</span>.
Recently there has been a surge of interest in this area (nancy rogers, LVH, utah guy, karinkski icmpc, form at SMT) probably due to the fact that educators are picking up on the fact that cognitive abilities are powerful predictors and need to be understood since they inevitably will play a role in pedagogical settings.</p>
<p>Before diving into a discussion regarding differences in cognitive ability, I should note that sometimes ideas regarding differences in cognitive ability been hostily received (citation against people talking about IQ) and for good reasons.
Research in this area can and has been taken advantage to further dangerous ideologies (Bell Curve), but often arguments that assert meaningful differences in cognitive abilities between groups are founded on statistical misunderstandings and have been debunked in other literature <span class="citation">(Gould <a href="#ref-gouldMismeasureMan1996">1996</a>)</span>.
With that cleared out of the way, it is very hard to maintain a scientific commitment to the theory of evolution <span class="citation">(Darwin <a href="#ref-darwinOriginSpecies1859">1859</a>)</span> and not expect variation in all aspects of human behavior, with cognition falling within that umbrella.</p>
<p>Attempting to measure aspects of cognition go back over a century.
Even before concepts of intelligence were posited by Charles Spearman and his conception of <em>g</em> <span class="citation">(Spearman <a href="#ref-spearmanGeneralIntelligenceObjectively1904">1904</a>)</span>, scientists were interested in finding links between an individual’s mental abilities and some sort of physical manifestation.
This area of research was pretty dark and kind of implicitly was all about validating preconceutalized ideas that people had on the superiority of peoples, with white dudes always coming out on top.
For example, THIS GUY WHO TRIED TO QUANTIFY GREATNESS
Also this guy who basically measured people’s skull sizes.
But of course this stuff is not meaningful at all, especially when the dependent variable in this was so subjective and constrained by a culture where one ruling people (white dudes) had all the power.</p>
<p>I only mention this because this line of thinking was co-opted by the American herediterian school of IQ (page 187 in Gould), where people that were after the same sort of idea (superiority of white people) basically took ideas of Alfred Binet, one of the first people to begin to systematically investigate cognitive ability in children at request of the french government so that children who were, what today we would call learning disabled, could be identified and given special attention.
Binet also took a lot of inspiration from Broca, WHO I TALK ABOUT ABOVE ON SKULL SIZE.</p>
<p>Bient was the initial developer of the idea of an intelligence quotient (divide mental age by chronological age then multiply by 100) and provided one of the first ways to attempt to measure something that was not capable of being manifested in the physical world.
Around the same time have people like Cyril Burt and Charles spearmean developing new theories of intelligence based on the reification factor analysis and calling it g that is based on solving problems without prior knowledge.</p>
<p>sentence here about g and the positive manifold</p>
<p>Of course took this aside to talk about that basically Binet and Spearman’s ideologies about what can be measured still represent two of the largest schools of thought on ways to measure cognitive ability.
On one hand there idea that cognitive abilities are based upon a steady growth of incoming information that someone is able to manipulate once they retrieve from long term memory, the other hand is that in addition to that there is some sort of construct in the mind that differs between people that can singularly reflect their intelligence, often referred to as g.</p>
<p>Basic assumption is that there is something in the brain here where differences will lead to different behaviors.
Without detailing entire histories of this line of thought, Binet basically turned into an argument for general crystallized intelligence, or DEFINITINO HERE (citation).
The Spearman, Burt strain of thought evolved into the <em>g</em> school, and recent research has suggested that the concept of <em>g</em> basically is statistically equivalent to idea conceptualized as general fluid intelligence (cite that in POT).
Both of these constructs are powerful predictors on a large scale, but they don’t explain the entire picture.</p>
<p>Another large area in the field of cognitive psychology is the area of working memory capacity.
As noted in Cowan 2005, what the term refers depends on the framework that is being used, but generally refers to the amount of information that can be actively held in conscious representation, akin to short term memory, but with some important caveats discussed below.
In addition to concepts of intelligence, be it Gf or Gc, the working memory capacity literature has done a lot of the heavy theoretical lifting, and after reviewing it we will have a much better idea of how once you decide about how you conceptualize it, then it’s helpful.</p>
<p>Given this brief background on cognitive ability, going to now dive deeper into both working memory capacity, as well as general fluid intelligence (avoid calling it <em>g</em> for good reasons) and review literature where these have been discussed as they relate to research on music perception, thus being related to melodic dictation, a skill that you need to perceive music to be able to do?</p>

<div id="working-memory-capacity" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Working Memory Capacity</h3>
<p>Working memory is one of the most investigated concepts in the cognitive psychology literature.
According to Nelson Cowan, the term working memory generally refers to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the relativly small amount of information that one can hold in mind, attend to, or, technically speaking, maintain in a rapidly accesible state at one time. The term working is mean to indicate that mental work requires the use of such informaiton. (p.1) <span class="citation">(Cowan <a href="#ref-cowanWorkingMemoryCapacity2005">2005</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term, like most concepts in science, does not have an exact operant definition, nor does it have a definitive method of measurement.
While there is no universally recognized first use of the term, researchers began to postulate that there was some sort of system that mediated incoming sensory information with the world with the information in long term storage using modular models of memory in the mid twentieth century.
Summarized in <span class="citation">(Cowan <a href="#ref-cowanWorkingMemoryCapacity2005">2005</a>)</span>, one of the first modal models of memory was proposed by <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="broadbentPerceptionCommunication1958"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> and later expanded by <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="atkinsonHUMANMEMORYPROPOSED1968"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.
As seen in FIGURE X, both models here posit incoming information that is then put into some sort of limited capacity store.
These modal models were then expanded on by Baddeley and Hitch <span class="citation">(Baddeley and Hitch <a href="#ref-baddeleyWorkingMemory1974">1974</a>)</span> in their 1974 chapter with the name <em>Working Memory</em>, where they proposed a system with an Central Executive module that was able to carry out active maintenance and rehearsal of information that could be stored in either a phonological store for sounds or a visual sketchpad for images.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-1"></span>
<img src="img/wm_models.png" alt="Test" width="353" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.1: Test
</p>
</div>
<p>Later revisions of their model also incorporated an episodic buffer <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="baddeleyEpisodicBufferNew2000"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> where the modules were explicitly depicted as being able to interface with long term memory in the rehearsal processes.
The model has even been expanded upon by other researchers throughout its lifetime.
The most notable and relevant to this study by is by <span class="citation">(Berz <a href="#ref-berzWorkingMemoryMusic1995">1995</a>)</span>, who postulated adding a musical rehearsal loop to the already established phonological loop and visual spatial sketchpad.
While Berz is correct in asserting that the nature of storing and processing musical information is probably different to that of words or pictures and there has been experimental evidence to suggest that they are stored separately <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="williamsonMusiciansNonmusiciansShortterm2010"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> and interpreted in favor of multiple loops <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="wollnerAttentionalFlexibilityMemory2016"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> , it does introduce the theoretical problem of multiple stores which has been addressed by other researchers.</p>
<p>In addressing the problem of explicitly stating which rehearsal loops do and do not exist, Nelson Cowan has proposed other models <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="cowanEvolvingConceptionsMemory1988"><strong>???</strong></span>; Cowan <a href="#ref-cowanWorkingMemoryCapacity2005">2005</a>)</span> such as the Embedded Process Model which do not claim the existence of any domain specific module (e.g. positing a phonological loop, visual spatial sketchpad) but propose an exhaustive model that did away with the problem of asserting specific buffers for new types of information.</p>
<p>In Cowan’s own words comparing his model from that of Baddeley:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aim was to see if the description of the processing structure could be exhaustive, even if not complete, in detail. By analogy, consider two descriptions of a house that has not been explored completely. Perhapis it has only been examined from the outside. Baddeley’s (1986) approach to modeling can be compared with hpyothesizing that there is a kitchen, a bathroom, two equal-size square bedrooms, and a living room. This is not a bad guess, but it does not rule out the possibllity that there actually are extra bedrooms or bathroom, that the bedrrom space is apportioned into tow rooms very different in size, or that other rooms exist in the house. Cowan’s (1988) apporach, on the other hand, can becomared with hypothesizing that the house includes food preparating quarters, sleeping quarters, batroom/toilet quarters, and other living quarters. It is meant to be exhaustive in that nothing was left out, even thoug it is noncommital on the details of some of the rooms. p.42</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The system is depicted in the bottom tier of TABLE X, and conceptualizes the limited amount of information that is readily available as being in the focus of attention, with activated sensory and categorical features of what is in the focus of attention to be nearly accessible.
Moving further from the locus of attention is long term memory, whose content can be turned to by using the central executive to access non immediately available information.
In contrast to the modular approaches, Cowan’s framework does not require the researchers to specify exactly how and where each the incoming information is being storied which makes it advantageous for studying complex stimuli such as music and melodies.</p>
<p>In addition to having multiple frameworks for studying working memory capacity, there is also the problem of if there are limits to the working memory system, often referred to as the working memory capacity.
Most popularized by Miller in his famous <span class="citation">(Miller <a href="#ref-millerMagicalNumberSeven1956">1956</a>)</span> article, he suggests out of jest that the number 7 might be worth investigating, which has been used as a point of reference for many researchers since then that have not critically engaged with the article.
Miller has even gone on record as noting that using 7 (plus or minus 2) was a rhetorical device used to string together his speech <span class="citation">(Miller <a href="#ref-millerHistoryPsychologyAutobiography1989">1989</a>)</span>.
Nevertheless, while probably bogus, this number has been since reduced to about 4 <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="cowanMagicalMysteryFour2010"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> and research around this has been discussed and has been arrived at by using complex span tasks.</p>
<p>When used as predictors in both higher and lower cognitive tasks, measures of working memory capacity predict performance well and additionally tend to be stable across a lifetime <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="unsworthAutomatedVersionOperation2005"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.
Given it’s predictive strength as well as it’s direct similarity to tasks of melodic dictation, a in depth look at the literature is warranted.</p>
<p>Clearly an individual’s ability to take in sensory information, maintain it in memory, actively carry out other tasks (like noting that melody) are almost identical to tasks of working memory capacity.
Although this parallel is striking, typical tasks looking at working memory capacity are different than melodic dictation tasks in a few key ways.
The first is that music is always sequential: a melodic dictation task would never require the student to recall the pitches back in scrambled orders.
Serial order recall is an important characteristic is the scoring and analyzing of working memory tasks <span class="citation">(Conway et al. <a href="#ref-conwayWorkingMemorySpan2005">2005</a>)</span>, musical tones do not appear in random order and are normally in chunks.
The use of chunks is pervasive in much of the memory literature, but often is used as more of a heuristic to help explain that information in the environment is often grouped together.
Of the problems with chunking that are relevant to music is that chunks, especially in music during the melodic dictation process —–are hierarchically organized <span class="citation">(Krumhansl <a href="#ref-krumhanslCognitiveFoundationsMusical2001">2001</a>; Meyer <a href="#ref-meyerEmotionMeaningMusic1956">1956</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>BELOW HERE IS A LIST OF ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH CHUNKING AND HOW THEY ARE RELATED TO MUSIC AND KARPINKSI’S TAXONOMY FROM COWAN 2005</p>

<p>This all said, WM literature has done a lot of the theoretical lifting, and WMC is important thing to consider.</p>
<p>Look how Berz ends his article</p>
<p>Important to note here that still area worth looking at because as Berz notes in the last sentence of his article that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individual differences portrayed in some music aptitude tests may [sic] represent not talent or musical intelligence but ability, reflecting differences in working memory capacity. p. 362</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it’s publication, some studies have looked at this….</p>
<div id="papers-that-suggest-wmc-plays-a-role" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.1</span> Papers that suggest WMC plays a role</h4>
<p>Of the papers in the music science literature that specifically talk about working memory capacity, each uses different measures of working memory capacity, but all tend to converge on findings that there are some sort of enhanced memory capabilities in individuals with musical training and that working memory capacity, however it is measured, often plays a significant role in musical tasks.
Evidence for this comes in a recent meta analyses by Talamini and colleagues <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="talaminiMusiciansHaveBetter2017"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> who demonstrated via three separate meta-studies that musicians outperform their non-musical counterparts on tasks dealing with long term memory, short term memory, as well as working memory.
The authors also noted that the effects were the strongest in working memory tasks where the stimuli were tonal, which again suggests an advantage of exposure and understanding of the hierarchical organization of musical materials.
In this meta study and others, it is important to remind that the direction of causality still can not be determined in these types of models.
While it might seem that musical training tends to lead to these increases, it is also equally possible that higher functioning individuals will self select into musical ability or most people will try it out and higher functioning people will be more likely not to quit in the long run.</p>
<p>In terms of musical performance abilities, working memory capacity has also been shown to be a significant predictor.
Kopiez and Lee suggested that working memory capacity ought to contribute to sight reading tasks since they found their measures of working memory capacity as measured by a matrix span task to significantly correlated with many of their measures hypothesized to be related to sight reading ability in pianists at lower difficulty grading <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="kopiezDynamicModelSkills2006"><strong>???</strong></span>; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="kopiezGeneralModelSkills2008"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>
<p>Following up on this work on sight reading, Meinz and Hambrick found that working memory capacity as measured by an operation span task, a reading span task, rotation span task, and a matrix span task was able to predict a small amount of variance <span class="math inline">\(R^2=.074(0.067)\)</span> above and beyond that of deliberate practice alone <span class="math inline">\(R^2=.451(.441)\)</span> in a sight reading task.
More recently, two studies looking at specific sub groups of music have shown working memory capacity to significantly contribute to models of performances on musical tasks.
<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="wollnerAttentionalFlexibilityMemory2016"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> found that although no differences were found between pianists and conductors in measures of working memory capacity as measured via a set of span tasks, conductors showed superior performance in their attention flexibility.
Following up on this line of research <span class="citation">(Nichols, Wöllner, and Halpern <a href="#ref-nicholsScoreOneJazz2018">2018</a>)</span> used the same battery of working memory tasks and found that jazz musicians excelled over their classically trained counterparts in a task which required them to hear notes and reproduce them on the piano.
The authors also noted that of their working memory battery, based on standard operation span methods <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="engleWorkingMemoryCapacity2002"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, that auditory dilation condition scored surprisingly low and further research on dictation warrants more research.
Additionally <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="colleyWorkingMemoryAuditory2018"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> 2017 found that working memory capacity as measured by a backwards digit span and operation span to be successful predictors in a tapping task requiring sensory motor prediction abilities.
Note that each of the tasks mentioned above deal with the the active memory and manipulation of novel musical material and deal with a different type of musical expertise that (e.g., Howe, Davidson, &amp; Sloboda, 1998) argued against the need for WMC at expert level performances.</p>
<p>The growing evidence in this field suggests that the advantage of working memory capacity to be greatest in both musically trained people, dealing with novel information, using tonal materials.
Since all three of these factors are related to melodic dictation, it would seem sensible to continue to include these measures in tasks of musical perception and continue Berz’s idea that we could just be picking up on individual differences in musical memory.</p>

<p>As reviewed in <span class="citation">(Schellenberg <a href="#ref-schellenbergMusicNonmusicalAbilities2017">2017</a>)</span>, both children and adults who engage in musical activity tend to score higher on general measurses of intelligence than their non-musical peers (Gibson, Folley and Park, 2009; Hille et al., 2011; Schellenberg, 2011a; Schellenberg and Mankarious, 2012). with the duration of training sharing a relationship with the extent of the increases in IQ (Degé, Kubicek and Schwarzer, 2011a; Degé, Wehrum, Stark and Schwarzer, 2015; Corrigall and Schellenberg, 2015; Corrigall, Schellenberg and Misura, 2013; Schellenberg, 2006).
Though many of these studies are correlational, they also have made attempts to control for confounding variables like socio-economic status and parental involvment in out of school activities. (Corrigall et al., 2013; Degé et al., 2011a; Schellenberg, 2006, 2011a, 2011b; Schellenberg and Mankarious, 2012).
Schellenberg notes the problem of smaller sample sizes in his review (Corrigall and Trainor, 2011; Parbery-Clark et al., 2011; Strait, Parbery-Clark, Hittner and Kraus, 2012) in that they normally do not reach significance.
And also references evidence that when professional musicians are matched with non-musicians in the public, also do not seem to see these associations. Schellenberg, 2015 which Schellenberg takes as more evidence that it is actually just higher functioning kids that take music lessons.
Additionally, Schellenberg remains skeptical of any sorts of causal factors regarding increases in IQ (e.g., François et al., 2013; Moreno et al., 2009) noting methodlogical problems like how short exposure times were, or researchers who did not hold pre-exisiting cognitive abilitis constant (Mehr, Schachner, Katz and Spelke, 2013).</p>

<p>Standing in contrast to factors that individuals do not have a much control over such as the size of their working memory capacity or factors related to their general fluid intelligence, most of the factors we believe contribute to someone’s ability to take melodic dictation have to deal with factors related to training and the environment.
In fact, one of the tacit assumptions of getting a music degree revolves around the implicitly held belief that with deliberate and attentive practice, that an individual is able to move from novice to expertise in their chosen domain.
The idea that time invested results in beneficial returns is probably best exemplified by work produced by ANDERS ERICKSON 1993 that suggests that performance at more elite levels has to do with deliberate practice.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.8</span> Sight Singing</h3>
<p>Often described as the other side of the same coin of melodic dictation, sight singing is an area of music pedagogy research that has had sparse attention paid to it given its prevelance in school of music curricula.
Recently <span class="citation">(Fournier et al. <a href="#ref-fournierCognitiveStrategiesSightsinging2017a">2017</a>)</span> catalouged and categorized 14 different sub categories into four larger main cateogories while also providing commenatary on some of the current state of aural skills.
Of the four large categories, they group them into reading mechanisms, sight singing, readings skills acquiskiton, and learnign support.
The authors note a line of research that has documented that university students are often unprepared to sight-read single lines of music (Asmus, 2004; Davidson, Scripp &amp; Welsh, 1988; Fournier, 2015; Thompson, 2004; Vujović &amp; Bogunović, 2012) even though it is, like dictation, thought of as a means for deeper musical understanding. (DeBellis, 2005; Karpinski, 2000; Ottman, 1956; Rogers, 2004; Scripp, 1995; Scripp &amp; Davidson, 1994
The authors of Fournier et. al also note that sight-reading has been an active area of research due to the often reported relationship that performance on sight reading often predicts several studies have shown links
between academic success in sight-singing and predictors such as entrance tests (Harrison,
1987, 1990, 1991; Ottman, 1956; Rodeheaver, 1972; Schleuter, 1983), academic ability
(Chadwick, 1933; Harrison, 1990, 1991; Harrison, Asmus, &amp; Serpe, 1994; Rodeheaver,
1972), and musical experience (Brown, 2001; Dean, 1937; Furby, 2008; Harrison, 1990,
1991; Harrison et al., 1994; Thostenson, 1967).</p>
<p>Learning to a fluid and compotent sight reader presumable bootstraps learning other musical skills, for the same reasons aural skills are taught in schools.
Though since it’s not directly related and now starting to move away from things looking at dictation directly, time to turn attention to the other half of the taxonomy, the musical factors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="musical-factors" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Musical Factors</h2>
<p>Moving to the other half of the taxonomy on figure X, the other big moving part of any study that attempts to look at melodic dictaiton would be the effects of the melody.
Intuitivly, everyone has a belief that some melodies are more difficult than others and when stated in the null, with all melodies being equally difficult to dictate, obviously rings true on intuition.
According to the way that I was taxonomizing it, the musical factors split into two separate, but not completley split categories.
One aspect of this would be the <strong>structural</strong> aspects of a melody.
These aspects would be related to discrete pitch and time components of the melody and then any sort of parameter that would result from a certain combintation of pitches over time such as contour all which are range invariant.
On the other hand would be what I have termed the <strong>experimental aspects</strong> of a melody.
The experimental aspects of a melody would be related to aspects of a melody that could be changed that would still make the melody be the same to a reasonable degree like changing the tempo, key, timbre, range, or mode, ore even elaborate ornamentation of the melody.
Of course there is not a strict deliniation between these two categories since once could imagine enough of the experimental parameters modulated to have the melody be categorically different.
Questions of musical similarity fall have been addressed CAMPAPERBOULIS and are beyond the scope of this study.</p>

<p>These are general models about melodic perception, though there is a history of looking at melodic dictaiton specifically.
Much of this comes from the world of music education, though not exclusivly.</p>
<p>Finally turning to studies specifically looking at melodic dictation looking specifically at musical structure, the first study to examine it extensively was <span class="citation">(Ortmann <a href="#ref-ortmannTonalDeterminantsMelodic1933">1933</a>)</span>.
Ortamnn used a series of twenty five note melodies in order to examine the effects of repetition, pitch direction, conjunct-disjunct motion (contour), interval size, order, and chord structure, all of which he deems to be the <em>determinants</em> of an individual’s ability to dictate melodic material.
This work was extended by * <span class="citation">(Taylor and Pembrook <a href="#ref-taylorStrategiesMemoryShort1983">1983</a>)</span> Extensin of Ortmann and looked at more musical skills, shows ways to suggest scoring simple melodies</p>
<p>Although the literature is generally sparce compared to other areas of music cognition, literature exploring the effects of structural characteristics on memory does exist.
Long found that length, tonal structure, contour, and individual traits all contribute and also found that structure and tonalness have significant, albeit small predictive powers in modeling LONG 1977.
Problem with long is that they eliminated people who were bad singers for the example.
This in some ways might be problematic in that it is at odds both with intuition of representation not being perfect mapping to singing <span class="citation">(Pfordresher and Brown <a href="#ref-pfordresherPoorPitchSingingAbsence2007">2007</a>)</span> and that just because someone is bad at singing does not make them bad at representation and the task.</p>

Simple thought expeiment that hard work does not always equal sucess in that there are sucssfull people who have not worked hard and very hard workers who do not experience sucess in what they do.
Additionally people need to keep up the skills they have, insert hilarious quote here from potter not believing that people didnt keep up their melodic dictation skills and show that they are compartmentalized <span class="citation">(Potter <a href="#ref-potterIdentifyingSucessfulDictation1990">1990</a>)</span>

<p>With this new encoding and higher computer power comes ability to do more complicated work.
Meyer would have loved it.</p>
<p>While I reserve a longer discussion on the history of computational musicology for the fourth chapter, relevant to this study is the different ways that is possible to talk abstracted features of melodies.
Abstracted features of melodies largely be conceptualized as being <strong>static</strong> or <strong>dynamic</strong>.
In the above papers, tended to use more simplisitc methods of figuring out parameters, now able to expand using both approaches.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.4</span> Static Views of Computational Features/ FANTASTIC</h4>
<p>A static conceptualization of a melody takes a summary feature of it.
Helps quantify something that might be intuitive about a melody or piece of encoded music.
Do stuff like compare distribution of notes to profiles generated for key finding algorithms (krumhansl, Albrect and shan)
Or also has measures of note density.
Only problem with this is that not known at this point to what degree the summary features can be mapped on to human behavior.</p>
<p>Quintessential example of this is Feature Analsysi… <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="mullensiefenFantasticFeatureANalysis2009"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.
FANTASTIC is software that is capable summerizing musical material at for monophonic melodies.
In additon to computing 37 features such as contour variation, tonalnesss, note density, note length, and measures inspired by computational linguistics (THAT BOOK OF GERAINT), FANTASTIC also calculates m-types (melodic-rhyhmic motives) that are based on the frequency distributions of melodic segements found genres of music.
This is inspired by fact that repeition is key structure of music <span class="citation">(Huron <a href="#ref-huronSweetAnticipation2006">2006</a>)</span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this chapter I have first described what is melodic dictation, Karpinki’s verbal model of it, noted what the things were that were missing from this model as a stepping off point, then went on to suggest a taxonomy of these based on what already has done.
Suggest that there are both individual as well as musical features that are at play here.
Individual features can be either cognitive, sort of fixed, or environmental, having do with training.
Musical features can be either structural, or experimental like how you play the melody.
None of these are necessarily hard and fast divisions, and certainly there are going to be some interactions between any and all of the levels.
Clearly a very great question and given how much we look at it, want to know more about this complicated network of processes.
Given this laundry list of factors, now going to explore the individual parameters in Chapter 3, the musical chapters in 4 and 5, as well as how they would come together in chapter 6.
Also will then go into more detail about many of the papers that I mentioned.
Really there should be a chapter 7 where after thinking about all of this I put together a computational model that succeeds at incorporating a polymorphic view of musical training by making a process model inspired by Karpinki that is able to be both a research and pedagogical stepping off point for future research on modeling melodic dictation.</p>
<p>Following with this next logical step would be to explore the individual side of the the taxonomy.
