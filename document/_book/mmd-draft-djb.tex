\chapter{Significance of the Study}\label{significance-of-the-study}}

All students pursing a Bachelor's degree in Music from universities
accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music must learn to
take melodic dictation \citep[ Section
VIII.6.B.2.A]{NationalAssociationSchools2018}. Melodic dictation is a
cognitively demanding process that requires students to listen to a
melody, retain it in memory, and then use their knowledge of Western
musical notation in order to recreate the mental image of the melody on
paper in a limited time frame. As of 2018 there are 647 Schools of Music
belonging to National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) CITE
WEBSITE, meaning that hundereds of students every year will be expected
to learn this challenging task as part of their Aural Skills education.
The logic being that as one improves in their abiliy to take melodic
dictation, this practice of critical and active listening develops as a
means to improve one's ability to ``think in music'' and thus become a
more compotent musician. While learning Aural Skills has been a hallmark
of being educated within the Western conservatory tradition, the
rationale behind both the how and why of aural skills is often thought
of as being esoteric. Throughout the past century, people have disagreed
on exactly how one does go about learning a melody with different areas
of research each attacking the problem from a different angle.

Despite its ubiqiquity in curricula within School of Music settings,
research on topics pertain to how aural skills are acquired is limited
at best. {[}Citations here about the cosntant calls butler, klondoski,
pembrook{]} The fields of music theory and cognitive psychology are best
positioned to make progress on this question, but often the skills
required to be well versed ein ither of these subjects are disparate,
published in other journals, and the research with overlap is scarce.
This problem is not new and there have been repeated attempts to bridge
the gap between practioners of aural skills and people in cognitive
psycholgy CITES. Literature from music theory has establisehd conceptual
frameworks regarding aural skills
\citet{karpinskiAuralSkillsAcquisition2000} and the relavint cognitive
psychology literature has explored factors that might contribute to
melodic perception (SCHMUKLER SYNERR 2016 2016), and there exists
applied literature from the world of music education (CITES).

However, despite these siloed areas of research, we as music researchers
do not have an a concrete understanding of exaclty what contributes to
HOW individuals learn melodies (HALPERNBARLETT2010). This is peculiar
since ``how does one learn a melody'' seems to be one of the fundamental
questions to the fields of music theory, music psychology, as well as
music education. Given this lack of understanding, it becomes even more
peculiar that this lack of convergence of evidence is then unable to
provide a solid baseline as to what student in their aural skills
classrooms can be expected to do. (Also something about we should really
know this if we are going to grade people on this ability). While no
single dissertation can solve any problem completely, this dissertation
aims to fill the gap in the literature between aural skills
practitioners (theorists and educators) and music psychologists in order
to reach conclusion that can be applied systematically in pedagogical
contexts. In order to do this I draw both literatures (music and
science) in order to demonstrate how tools from both cognitive
psychology as well as computational musicology can help move both fields
forward. Some line here about if we really want to understand what is
happening we need to know about causal factors going on here and have
experimental manipulation and things like making models of the whole
thing or talk about what Judea Pearl thinks about the ability to do some
sort of causal modeling with diagrams. Great to rely on some sort of
anecdoatal evidence, but if we are going to put things on the line with
our education then we need to be able to make some sort of falsifiable
claims about what we are doing. Can only do that through the lens of
science.

\section{Chapter Overview}\label{chapter-overview}}

In this first chapter, I introduce the process of melodic dictation and
discuss factors that would presumably could play a role in taking
melodic dictation. The chapter introduces both a theoretical backgorund
and rationale for using method form both computational musicology and
congitive psychology in order ot answr quesitona bout how individuals
learn melodies. I argue that tools for understanding this best because
as we currently understand it, I see us operating in a Kuhnian normal
science where much can be learned by just using the tools in front of
us. This chapter will clearly outline the factors hypothesized to
contribute to an individual's abilit to learn melodies, incorporating
both individual and musical parameters. The chapter ends with a
discussion some of the philosophical/theoretical problems with
attempting to measure thigns like this (is it just a party trick?) and
establishes that I will be taking a more polymorphic view of
musicianship in order to answer this question.

The second chapter of my dissertation focuses on the history and current
state of aural skills pedagogy.

Tracing back its origins to the practical need to teach musical skills
back with Guido d'Arezzo, I compare and contrast the different
methodological approaches that have been used, along with their goals.

The third chapter discusses previous work that examines individual
factors thought to contribute to one's ability to perform an aural
skills task, and it will discuss results from an experiment contributing
to a discussion of how individual differences could contribute to how a
person learns melodies.

Turning away from individual differences and focusing on musical
features, in the fourth chapter I plan to discuss how music researchers
can use tools from computational musicology as predictive features of
melodies. Inspired by work from computational linguistics and
information theory, recent work in computational musicology has
developed software capable of abstracting features thought to be
important to learning melodies, such as note density and `tonalness'
(Müllensiefen, 2009). Talk a bit about how this has been also looked at
before in the music education community.

While these features have been used in large scale, exploratory studies,
work in this chapter will discuss how these features could be used in
controlled, experimental studies as a stand-in for the intuition many
music pedagogues have when determining difficulty of a melody in a
classroom setting.

In my fifth chapter, I introduce a novel corpus of over 600 digitized
melodies encoded in a queryable format. This dataset will also serve as
a valuable resource for future researchers in music, psychology, and the
digital humanities. This chapter begins with a discussion of the history
of corpus studies, noting their origin outside of music, their current
state in music, and their limitations. This chapter, encapsulating the
encoding process, the sampling criteria, and the situation of corpus
methodologies within the broader research area, will go over summary
data and also talk about how it could be used to generate hypotheses for
future experiemnts (n-gram stuff based on patterns) .

Lastly, in the final chapter, I will synthesize the previous research in
a series of melodic dictation experiments. Stimuli for the experiments
are selected based on the abstracted features of the melodies and are
manipulated as independent variables based on the previous theoretical
literature. I then model responses from the experiments using both
individual factors and musical features in order to predict how well an
individual performs in behavioral tasks similar to some of my previously
published research (Baker \& Müllensiefen, 2017). Here I also note
important caveats in scoring melodic dictation, referencing some other
of my own work on using metrics, such as edit distance (Baker \&
Shanahan, 2018), to discuss similarities between the correct answer and
an individual's attempts at dictation. Results from the final chapter
will be discussed with reference to how findings are applicable to
pedagoges in aural skills settings. Recommendations will be made
building on current conceptual frameworks (Karpinski, 2000).

\section{What is melodic dictation? and
Why?}\label{what-is-melodic-dictation-and-why}}

Melodic dictation is the process in which an individual hears a melody,
retains it in memory, and then uses their knowledge of Western musical
notation to recreate the mental image of it on paper in a limited time
frame. For many, becoming proficient at this task is at the core of
developing one's aural skills \citep{karpinskiModelMusicPerception1990}.
For over a century, music pedagogues have highly valued melodic
dictation\footnote{In his highly influential book \emph{Aural Skills
  Acquisition: The Development of Listening, Reading, and Performing
  Skills in College-Level Musicians}, Gary
  \citet{karpinskiAuralSkillsAcquisition2000} documents this deeply held
  belief in music pedagogy circles by listing poetic adages from
  romantic composer Robert Schumann in the mid 19th century through
  music educator Charles Elliott in the opening of his book, providing
  concrete examples of the belief that improving one's aural skills, or
  \emph{ear}, is a highly sought after advanced skill. } and most aural
skills texts that have sections devoted to honing one's listening skills
have material on melodic dictation
\citep{karpinskiAuralSkillsAcquisition2000}. Additionally, any school
accredited by the North American Schools of Music requires learning this
skill be part of any accredited curricula. Yet despite this tradition
and ubiquity, the rationales as to \emph{why} it is important for
students to learn this ability often comes from some sort of appeal to
tradition or underwhelming anecdotal evidence that time spent learning
to take melodic dictation results in increases in near transfer
abilities after they have acquired a certain degree of proficiency.
Rationales given for why students should learn melodic dictation has
even been described by Gary Karpinski as being based on ``comparatively
vague aphorisms about mental relationships and intelligent listening''
\citep[p.192]{karpinskiModelMusicPerception1990}, with the argument for
learning to take melodic dictation historically not being well supported
with persuasive evidence.

Some researchers have even taken a more skeptical stance and have noted
that the rationale for why we teach melodic dictation deserves more
critique. For example, Klonoski in writing about aural skills education
aptly questions ``What specific deficiency is revelaned with an
incorrect response in melodic dictation settings?''
\citep{klonoskiImprovingDictationAuralSkills2006}. Earlier researchers
like Potter, in their own publication, have noted that they have been
baffled that many musicians do not actually keep up with their melodic
dictation abilities after the class ends
\citep{potterIdentifyingSucessfulDictation1990}, but presumably go on to
have successful and fulfilling musical lives. Additionally, suggesting
that people who can hear music and then are unable to write it down, and
thus are unable to think \emph{in} music, seems somewhat exclusionary to
the vast amount of musical cultures out there that do not depend on any
sort of written notation.

Though despite this skepticism towards the topic, melodic dictation
remains at the forefront of many aural skills classrooms. While the act
of becoming better at this skill may or may not lead to large in
increases in far transfer of ability, as a pedagogical tool, teaching
students to take melodic dictation brings with it the concepts that are
hoped to be instilled in music students long term. While not there has
not been extensive research on melodic dictation research in the past
few years, in fact \citep{paneyEffectDirectingAttention2016} notes that
since 2000, only four studies were published that directly examined
melodic dictation, this skill set sits on the border between literature
on learning, melodic perception, memory, and music theory pedagogy and
understanding and modeling exactly how it works remains as a untapped
watershed of knowledge for the field of music theory, music education,
and music perception and is deserving of much more attention.

\hypertarget{describing-melodic-dictation}{%
\subsection{Describing Melodic
Dictation}\label{describing-melodic-dictation}}

Much of the foundational work on the topic of melodic dictation comes
from the work of Gary Karpinski. Summarized most recently in his
\emph{Aural Skills Acquisition}
\citep{karpinskiAuralSkillsAcquisition2000}, though first presented in
an earlier article \citep{karpinskiModelMusicPerception1990}, Karpinski
proposes his own model of melodic dictation that provides a four step
framework as how the process of melodic dictation works.\footnote{In
  Karpinski 1990 he notes two other models of melodic dictation, one
  from Rogers where he says there are 2 processes, another from Thomas
  who says there are 15}

His four steps include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Hearing
\item
  Short Term Melodic Memory
\item
  Musical Understanding
\item
  Notation
\end{enumerate}

and occur as a looping, schematic process that is depicted in Figure 3.1
in his textbook, reproduced below and throughout the chapter Karpinski
discusses relevant factors at play at each stage. In the case of the
table above, the process happens twice, presumably with a melody that
can be extracted in two parts, which according to Karpinski and this
prescribed formulas would consist of a melody from twelve to twenty
notes long for listeners with few or no chunking abilities. Reviewing
the Karpinksi four step model will provide both a grounding in the
current model that has been used in other literature, and establish a
groundwork from which to build.

The \textbf{hearing} stage involves the initial perceptions of the sound
at a physical level of the tympanic membrane, as well as the listener's
\emph{attention} to the incoming musical information. If the listener is
not actively engaging in the task because of factors like ``boredom,
lack of discipline, test anxiety, attention deficit disorder, or any
number of other causes'' then any further processes down the model will
be detrimentally effected. While Karpinski notes that these types of
interference are normally ``beyond the traditional jurisdiction of aural
skills instruction'', I will later argue that the concept of willful
attention when re-conceptualized as working memory capacity, may
actually play a large role in the melodic dictation process.

The \textbf{short-term melodic memory} Karpinski relies on empirical
qualitative evidence from interview with students to show support for
two separate memory encoding mechanisms, one for contour, and one for
pitch. After citing literature supporting this claim (DOWLING 1978,
DeWITT AND CROWDWER 1986, DOWLING 1994) regarding contour, as well as
literature suggesting that in order to memorize chunks of melodic
material, it helps to have been enculturated (DEUTSCH 1977,Oura and
Hatano 1988, Handel 1989, Davies 1978, Dowling 1990) (a field of
research that has been explored a lot since this was published PEARCE
WORK), Karpinksi explains how ideas like extractive listening and
chunking then take part in this process. Noting that there is probably
some sort of capacity limit to music, citing Miller (1956) and
corroborating musical evidence (Marple n.d)\footnote{Should probably do
  some foot note here saying this is wrong use of miller for reasons in
  Cowan 2005 and Miller is even on record as saying the magic number 7
  was just used to thread his speech together\ldots{}}, Karpinski
details the two strategies from above to show how the dictation process
is done. Karpinski's extractive listening refers to only selectively
remembering parts of a melody. The chunking bit isa an idea that as
musical understanding increases, so does musical memory. The idea is
that if you can identify certain ideas that you hear in the incoming
signal, you can more effectively understand them.

In order to further explain the idea of \textbf{musical understanding}
Karpinski says its different ha musical memory. Musical memory for
Karpinski is ability to repeat what has been heard, and understanding is
about comprehending things like the hierarchical metrical relationships
between notes, rhythmic groupings and tonal functions. Within this whole
idea is the thing of solimization for both rhythm and pitch (the
takdimiti system KODALY) and relative pitch. Idea here is that hte two
are then going to be linked to one another and as information comes in
that can be musically understood, then it can then be moved from
perception to notation more quickly.

The \textbf{notation}, and final step of the dictation loop, require the
knowledge of Western musical notation to be able to write down what is
in one's musical short term memory and use their musical understanding
to decode that mental representation into written notation. This last
step is ripe for errors as Karpinski notes has been found in other areas
of research TAYLOR AND PEMBROOK 1983 and its noted that obviously it's
very hard to write something down if you don't have the category for it.

The final parts of the chapter, Karpinski notes that other factors like
\textbf{tempo}, the \textbf{length} and \textbf{number of playings}, and
the \textbf{duration between playings} will also play a role in
determining how an individual will perform on a melodic dictation. While
this framework can help illuminate this cognitive process and help
pedagogues understand how to best help their students, the model as it
stands is not detailed enough for explanatory purposes and does not
exhaust the many factors that further research since its publication
have demonstrated as relevant making a model of melodic dictation.

Again, though Karpinski did not intent to create an exhaustive model of
the melodic dictation process, by only creating a verbal model, the
model is unprepared to handle a few basic things which are just the next
logical research step.

From this point on, need tone to suggest that what Karpinski did is
good, but the next step is to get more formal with it and be able to
start investigating factors that go into doing melodic dictation. Would
be good to know how the process works and in order to do that need to
look at it as it happens with experimental approaches, and additionally
want to try to make a model of it to make sure we include everything.

Title of is modeling melodic dictation, want to have model that
describes it and its component parts, and want to have a model that
describes the process.

have argument

HERE IS WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT WHY THERE IS A NEED FOR A COMPUTATIONAL
MODEL AND EXPERIMENTAL MODEL

Primarily, having a single model for melodic dictation assumes that all
individuals are likely to engage in this sequential ordering of events.
This could in fact be the case, but there is research ANDREW GOLDMAN AND
STUFF that suggests that experts process and categorize musical
information differently. Additionally, different people will probably
have different experiences dictating melodies based on their own past
listening experience, a note that Karpinski makes earlier when THAT
CITATION FROM UP ABOVE. Not only will there be differences in ability,
additionally people differ in their cognitive abilities. The model does
not have any flexibility in terms of individual differences.

Secondly, the model also does not seem to treat melodies differently.
For example, on page 103, Karpinski suggest that two passes should be
adequate for a listen with few to no chunking skills to listen to be
able to dictate a melody of twelve to twenty notes. This also would be
an area of model improvement, as both the melodies listed below here are
XX notes, within Karpinski's prescribed range, but intuition might
suggest that the melodies are not equally difficult to dictate. The
model is agnostic towards differences in melodies.

In order to have a model that will eventually be able to incorporate
everything involved in the melodic dictation process, and to be
eventually implemented computationally, it is necessary to creates new
taxonomy of factors that could contribute to modeling melodic dictation.
In the 18 years since the publication of \emph{Aural Skills
Acquisition}, there has been a wealth of research that has been done on
factors related to melodic dictation. I am convinced that the best way
to taxonomize the multitude of factors contributing to this is to create
a taxonomy where musical and individual factors are at the highest.

\hypertarget{individual-factors-to-contribute}{%
\subsubsection{Individual Factors to
contribute}\label{individual-factors-to-contribute}}

From an individual stand point, can bifurcate factors broadly into
\emph{cognitive factors}, or factors of people that are relatively
consistent over people or basically like fixed effects things (use
definition of what is a fixed effect); and the other side of this would
be things that would have to be dealt with that change with training and
exposure. Going to refer to this second set of things as
\emph{environmental} factors. Is there a better way to talk about this
as nature vs nurture. Additionally need to then mention that there are
of course epigenitic factors where both of these parameters might
interact with one another. For example, might then imagine that someone
with higher cognitive ability, lots of training that was put forward by
their parents, as well as tons of musical training, and personality
traits that are more likely to learn more (daniels paper on that) might
be different in terms of results than someone with lower cognitive
abilities, no training, low SES, and a general inclination not to even
take music lessons. While obvious, what will eventually be of interest
is the degree to which each of these things contributes to the final
models. Also gives us a better idea about pedagogy and what not.

\hypertarget{musical-factors-to-contribute}{%
\subsubsection{Musical factors to
contribute}\label{musical-factors-to-contribute}}

In addition to differences at the individual level, there are also
musical level characteristics. In this category it is also worth
taxonimizing the musical characteristics into two categories as well. On
one hand we have the structural aspects of the melody itself. These are
aspects of the melody that would remain invariant when written down on a
score. Reading from left to right, would be things like range, key, time
signature, intervals, amount of notes, contour of the melody, tonal
properties, standardized note density. Then the other side would be
musical features that I am going to deem as experimental features of the
melody. These are aspects of the structure of the melody that you can
then warp within the context of a melodic dictation such as tempo, which
then reflects note density, timbral qualities, how many times the melody
is played, the space between hearings. This is not a categorical divide,
while I put something like range as key of the melody as structural, you
could imagine that you could have the same interval invariant structure
of a melody , perhaps Twinkle, Twinkle little star beginning on C2
notated in bass clef, but then imagine the the same ``melody'' being
played two and a half octaves up on F\#4, and transposed to minor and
played quicker leading to a phenomenologically similar experience, but
not the same. I taxonimze them early on, but again note that a model of
this should be able withstand the multitude of patterns that exist.

\hypertarget{make-a-model-of-them}{%
\subsubsection{Make a Model of them}\label{make-a-model-of-them}}

Given all of these factors that then go into the melodic dictation
process, the remainder of this chapter will detail previous research
that has gone into each of these factors. Talking about each one will
provide rationale for why it should be further investigated if we are to
better understand melodic dictation. Beginning with \emph{cognitive
factors} two levels, then go on to talk about \emph{musical features}.
After discussing both and their two subcompoents as I have taxonimzed
them, offer a brief discussion on how it's bad to think about these as
just latent abilities. Instead talk about thinking about modeling
melodic dictation, in terms of ACTUAL MODELING, as polymorphic
conceptualization of aural skills. This is important because how we talk
about and model things reflects or values and often it will get in the
way of stuff.

This is important because the end goal of this research is to be able to
model this from an experimental and computational level.

From an empirical standpoint, both the task as well as the process of
melodic dictation as depicted by Karpinksi resemble something that can
be turned into an experiment, as well as a computational model. It's
basically an experiment where we have in person level predictors and
melodies with different item level difficulty. This dissertation seeks
to explore the degree to which methodologies from cognitive psychology
and computational musicology are able to further this literature and
take the next logical step in terms of understanding aural skills.

\hypertarget{individual-factors}{%
\section{Individual Factors}\label{individual-factors}}

\hypertarget{cognitive}{%
\subsection{Cognitive}\label{cognitive}}

Research from the cognitive psychology literature suggests that
individuals differ in their perpetual and cognitive abilities in ways
that are not easily influenced by short term-training, are stable across
a lifetime, and that these abilities, when investigated on a large
scale, predict of a wealth of human behavior from longevity, to onset of
Alzheimer's disease, to the ability to deal with life stress events, and
even the effects of alcohol consumption
\citep{ritchieIntelligenceAllThat2015, unsworthAutomatedVersionOperation2005}.
Given the strength and generality of these predictors, it worth
investigating the extent that these abilities might play when
investigating modeling melodic dictation. This is also important to
understand because if we were to find out that something as simple as
general fluid intelligence was a strong predictor in musical tasks that
we are grading people on, it would be pretty unfair to do since we are
then basically grading people on genetic factors beyond their control,
as well as environmental factors shown to have some sort of effect on IQ
\citep{ritchieIntelligenceAllThat2015}. Recently there has been a surge
of interest in this area (nancy rogers, LVH, utah guy, karinkski icmpc,
form at SMT) probably due to the fact that educators are picking up on
the fact that cognitive abilities are powerful predictors and need to be
understood since they inevitably will play a role in pedagogical
settings.

Before diving into a discussion regarding differences in cognitive
ability, I should note that sometimes ideas regarding differences in
cognitive ability been hostily received (citation against people talking
about IQ) and for good reasons. Research in this area can and has been
taken advantage to further dangerous ideologies (Bell Curve), but often
arguments that assert meaningful differences in cognitive abilities
between groups are founded on statistical misunderstandings and have
been debunked in other literature \citep{gouldMismeasureMan1996}. With
that cleared out of the way, it is very hard to maintain a scientific
commitment to the theory of evolution \citep{darwinOriginSpecies1859}
and not expect variation in all aspects of human behavior, with
cognition falling within that umbrella.

Attempting to measure aspects of cognition go back over a century. Even
before concepts of intelligence were posited by Charles Spearman and his
conception of \emph{g}
\citep{spearmanGeneralIntelligenceObjectively1904}, scientists were
interested in finding links between an individual's mental abilities and
some sort of physical manifestation. This area of research was pretty
dark and kind of implicitly was all about validating preconceutalized
ideas that people had on the superiority of peoples, with white dudes
always coming out on top. For example, THIS GUY WHO TRIED TO QUANTIFY
GREATNESS Also this guy who basically measured people's skull sizes. But
of course this stuff is not meaningful at all, especially when the
dependent variable in this was so subjective and constrained by a
culture where one ruling people (white dudes) had all the power.

I only mention this because this line of thinking was co-opted by the
American herediterian school of IQ (page 187 in Gould), where people
that were after the same sort of idea (superiority of white people)
basically took ideas of Alfred Binet, one of the first people to begin
to systematically investigate cognitive ability in children at request
of the french government so that children who were, what today we would
call learning disabled, could be identified and given special attention.
Binet also took a lot of inspiration from Broca, WHO I TALK ABOUT ABOVE
ON SKULL SIZE.

Bient was the initial developer of the idea of an intelligence quotient
(divide mental age by chronological age then multiply by 100) and
provided one of the first ways to attempt to measure something that was
not capable of being manifested in the physical world. Around the same
time have people like Cyril Burt and Charles spearmean developing new
theories of intelligence based on the reification factor analysis and
calling it g that is based on solving problems without prior knowledge.

sentence here about g and the positive manifold

Of course took this aside to talk about that basically Binet and
Spearman's ideologies about what can be measured still represent two of
the largest schools of thought on ways to measure cognitive ability. On
one hand there idea that cognitive abilities are based upon a steady
growth of incoming information that someone is able to manipulate once
they retrieve from long term memory, the other hand is that in addition
to that there is some sort of construct in the mind that differs between
people that can singularly reflect their intelligence, often referred to
as g.

Basic assumption is that there is something in the brain here where
differences will lead to different behaviors. Without detailing entire
histories of this line of thought, Binet basically turned into an
argument for general crystallized intelligence, or DEFINITINO HERE
(citation). The Spearman, Burt strain of thought evolved into the
\emph{g} school, and recent research has suggested that the concept of
\emph{g} basically is statistically equivalent to idea conceptualized as
general fluid intelligence (cite that in POT). Both of these constructs
are powerful predictors on a large scale, but they don't explain the
entire picture.

Another large area in the field of cognitive psychology is the area of
working memory capacity. As noted in Cowan 2005, what the term refers
depends on the framework that is being used, but generally refers to the
amount of information that can be actively held in conscious
representation, akin to short term memory, but with some important
caveats discussed below. In addition to concepts of intelligence, be it
Gf or Gc, the working memory capacity literature has done a lot of the
heavy theoretical lifting, and after reviewing it we will have a much
better idea of how once you decide about how you conceptualize it, then
it's helpful.

Given this brief background on cognitive ability, going to now dive
deeper into both working memory capacity, as well as general fluid
intelligence (avoid calling it \emph{g} for good reasons) and review
literature where these have been discussed as they relate to research on
music perception, thus being related to melodic dictation, a skill that
you need to perceive music to be able to do?

\hypertarget{working-memory-capacity}{%
\subsection{Working Memory Capacity}\label{working-memory-capacity}}

Working memory is one of the most investigated concepts in the cognitive
psychology literature. According to Nelson Cowan, the term working
memory generally refers to

\begin{quote}
the relativly small amount of information that one can hold in mind,
attend to, or, technically speaking, maintain in a rapidly accesible
state at one time. The term working is mean to indicate that mental work
requires the use of such informaiton. (p.1)
\citep{cowanWorkingMemoryCapacity2005}
\end{quote}

The term, like most concepts in science, does not have an exact operant
definition, nor does it have a definitive method of measurement. While
there is no universally recognized first use of the term, researchers
began to postulate that there was some sort of system that mediated
incoming sensory information with the world with the information in long
term storage using modular models of memory in the mid twentieth
century. Summarized in \citep{cowanWorkingMemoryCapacity2005}, one of
the first modal models of memory was proposed by
\citep{broadbentPerceptionCommunication1958} and later expanded by
\citep{atkinsonHUMANMEMORYPROPOSED1968}. As seen in FIGURE X, both
models here posit incoming information that is then put into some sort
of limited capacity store. These modal models were then expanded on by
Baddeley and Hitch \citep{baddeleyWorkingMemory1974} in their 1974
chapter with the name \emph{Working Memory}, where they proposed a
system with an Central Executive module that was able to carry out
active maintenance and rehearsal of information that could be stored in
either a phonological store for sounds or a visual sketchpad for images.

{[}INSERT IMAGE FROM COWAN{]}

Later revisions of their model also incorporated an episodic buffer
\citep{baddeleyEpisodicBufferNew2000} where the modules were explicitly
depicted as being able to interface with long term memory in the
rehearsal processes. The model has even been expanded upon by other
researchers throughout its lifetime. The most notable and relevant to
this study by is by \citep{berzWorkingMemoryMusic1995}, who postulated
adding a musical rehearsal loop to the already established phonological
loop and visual spatial sketchpad. While Berz is correct in asserting
that the nature of storing and processing musical information is
probably different to that of words or pictures and there has been
experimental evidence to suggest that they are stored separately
\citep{williamsonMusiciansNonmusiciansShortterm2010} and interpreted in
favor of multiple loops \citep{wollnerAttentionalFlexibilityMemory2016}
, it does introduce the theoretical problem of multiple stores which has
been addressed by other researchers.

In addressing the problem of explicitly stating which rehearsal loops do
and do not exist, Nelson Cowan has proposed other models
\citep{cowanEvolvingConceptionsMemory1988, cowanWorkingMemoryCapacity2005}
such as the Embedded Process Model which do not claim the existence of
any domain specific module (e.g.~positing a phonological loop, visual
spatial sketchpad) but propose an exhaustive model that did away with
the problem of asserting specific buffers for new types of information.

In Cowan's own words comparing his model from that of Baddeley:

\begin{quote}
The aim was to see if the description of the processing structure could
be exhaustive, even if not complete, in detail. By analogy, consider two
descriptions of a house that has not been explored completely. Perhapis
it has only been examined from the outside. Baddeley's (1986) approach
to modeling can be compared with hpyothesizing that there is a kitchen,
a bathroom, two equal-size square bedrooms, and a living room. This is
not a bad guess, but it does not rule out the possibllity that there
actually are extra bedrooms or bathroom, that the bedrrom space is
apportioned into tow rooms very different in size, or that other rooms
exist in the house. Cowan's (1988) apporach, on the other hand, can
becomared with hypothesizing that the house includes food preparating
quarters, sleeping quarters, batroom/toilet quarters, and other living
quarters. It is meant to be exhaustive in that nothing was left out,
even thoug it is noncommital on the details of some of the rooms. p.42
\end{quote}

The system is depicted in the bottom tier of TABLE X, and conceptualizes
the limited amount of information that is readily available as being in
the focus of attention, with activated sensory and categorical features
of what is in the focus of attention to be nearly accessible. Moving
further from the locus of attention is long term memory, whose content
can be turned to by using the central executive to access non
immediately available information. In contrast to the modular
approaches, Cowan's framework does not require the researchers to
specify exactly how and where each the incoming information is being
storied which makes it advantageous for studying complex stimuli such as
music and melodies.

In addition to having multiple frameworks for studying working memory
capacity, there is also the problem of if there are limits to the
working memory system, often referred to as the working memory capacity.
Most popularized by Miller in his famous
\citep{millerMagicalNumberSeven1956} article, he suggests out of jest
that the number 7 might be worth investigating, which has been used as a
point of reference for many researchers since then that have not
critically engaged with the article. Miller has even gone on record as
noting that using 7 (plus or minus 2) was a rhetorical device used to
string together his speech
\citep{millerHistoryPsychologyAutobiography1989}. Nevertheless, while
probably bogus, this number has been since reduced to about 4
\citep{cowanMagicalMysteryFour2010} and research around this has been
discussed and has been arrived at by using complex span tasks.

When used as predictors in both higher and lower cognitive tasks,
measures of working memory capacity predict performance well and
additionally tend to be stable across a lifetime
\citep{unsworthAutomatedVersionOperation2005}. Given it's predictive
strength as well as it's direct similarity to tasks of melodic
dictation, a in depth look at the literature is warranted.

Clearly an individual's ability to take in sensory information, maintain
it in memory, actively carry out other tasks (like noting that melody)
are almost identical to tasks of working memory capacity. Although this
parallel is striking, typical tasks looking at working memory capacity
are different than melodic dictation tasks in a few key ways. The first
is that music is always sequential: a melodic dictation task would never
require the student to recall the pitches back in scrambled orders.
Serial order recall is an important characteristic is the scoring and
analyzing of working memory tasks \citep{conwayWorkingMemorySpan2005},
musical tones do not appear in random order and are normally in chunks.
The use of chunks is pervasive in much of the memory literature, but
often is used as more of a heuristic to help explain that information in
the environment is often grouped together. Of the problems with chunking
that are relevant to music is that chunks, especially in music during
the melodic dictation process -----are hierarchically organized
\citep{krumhanslCognitiveFoundationsMusical2001, meyerEmotionMeaningMusic1956}.

BELOW HERE IS A LIST OF ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH CHUNKING AND HOW THEY ARE
RELATED TO MUSIC AND KARPINKSI'S TAXONOMY FROM COWAN 2005

\item

\item

\end{enumerate}

This all said, WM literature has done a lot of the theoretical lifting,
and WMC is important thing to consider.

Look how Berz ends his article

Important to note here that still area worth looking at because as Berz
notes in the last sentence of his article that

\begin{quote}
Individual differences portrayed in some music aptitude tests may
{[}sic{]} represent not talent or musical intelligence but ability,
reflecting differences in working memory capacity. p.~362
\end{quote}

Since it's publication, some studies have looked at this\ldots{}.

\hypertarget{papers-that-suggest-wmc-plays-a-role}{%
\subsubsection{Papers that suggest WMC plays a
role}\label{papers-that-suggest-wmc-plays-a-role}}

Of the papers in the music science literature that specifically talk
about working memory capacity, each uses different measures of working
memory capacity, but all tend to converge on findings that there are
some sort of enhanced memory capabilities in individuals with musical
training and that working memory capacity, however it is measured, often
plays a significant role in musical tasks. Evidence for this comes in a
recent meta analyses by Talamini and colleagues
\citep{talaminiMusiciansHaveBetter2017} who demonstrated via three
separate meta-studies that musicians outperform their non-musical
counterparts on tasks dealing with long term memory, short term memory,
as well as working memory. The authors also noted that the effects were
the strongest in working memory tasks where the stimuli were tonal,
which again suggests an advantage of exposure and understanding of the
hierarchical organization of musical materials. In this meta study and
others, it is important to remind that the direction of causality still
can not be determined in these types of models. While it might seem that
musical training tends to lead to these increases, it is also equally
possible that higher functioning individuals will self select into
musical ability or most people will try it out and higher functioning
people will be more likely not to quit in the long run.

In terms of musical performance abilities, working memory capacity has
also been shown to be a significant predictor. Kopiez and Lee suggested
that working memory capacity ought to contribute to sight reading tasks
since they found their measures of working memory capacity as measured
by a matrix span task to significantly correlated with many of their
measures hypothesized to be related to sight reading ability in pianists
at lower difficulty grading
\citep{kopiezDynamicModelSkills2006, kopiezGeneralModelSkills2008}.

Following up on this work on sight reading, Meinz and Hambrick found
that working memory capacity as measured by an operation span task, a
reading span task, rotation span task, and a matrix span task was able
to predict a small amount of variance \(R^2=.074(0.067)\) above and
beyond that of deliberate practice alone \(R^2=.451(.441)\) in a sight
reading task. More recently, two studies looking at specific sub groups
of music have shown working memory capacity to significantly contribute
to models of performances on musical tasks.
\citep{wollnerAttentionalFlexibilityMemory2016} found that although no
differences were found between pianists and conductors in measures of
working memory capacity as measured via a set of span tasks, conductors
showed superior performance in their attention flexibility. Following up
on this line of research \citep{nicholsScoreOneJazz2018} used the same
battery of working memory tasks and found that jazz musicians excelled
over their classically trained counterparts in a task which required
them to hear notes and reproduce them on the piano. The authors also
noted that of their working memory battery, based on standard operation
span methods \citep{engleWorkingMemoryCapacity2002}, that auditory
dilation condition scored surprisingly low and further research on
dictation warrants more research. Additionally
\citep{colleyWorkingMemoryAuditory2018} 2017 found that working memory
capacity as measured by a backwards digit span and operation span to be
successful predictors in a tapping task requiring sensory motor
prediction abilities. Note that each of the tasks mentioned above deal
with the the active memory and manipulation of novel musical material
and deal with a different type of musical expertise that (e.g., Howe,
Davidson, \& Sloboda, 1998) argued against the need for WMC at expert
level performances.

The growing evidence in this field suggests that the advantage of
working memory capacity to be greatest in both musically trained people,
dealing with novel information, using tonal materials. Since all three
of these factors are related to melodic dictation, it would seem
sensible to continue to include these measures in tasks of musical
perception and continue Berz's idea that we could just be picking up on
individual differences in musical memory.

As discussed above gf has a long history, some good some bad. Thing is
that it can be really predictive of many things and people def do try

use IQ, but note that IQ and Gf's correlation tend to be statiscally
idential KOVACS AND CONWAY and many measures of IQ are done with Ravens
as seen below.

One of the big problems with this is establishing effects of causality
looking at music. Could be that factors outside of music play a role
like personal views of ability DANIEL PAPER , socio economic status, and
personality.

As reviewed in \citep{schellenbergMusicNonmusicalAbilities2017}, both
children and adults who engage in musical activity tend to score higher
on general measurses of intelligence than their non-musical peers
(Gibson, Folley and Park, 2009; Hille et al., 2011; Schellenberg, 2011a;
Schellenberg and Mankarious, 2012). with the duration of training
sharing a relationship with the extent of the increases in IQ (Degé,
Kubicek and Schwarzer, 2011a; Degé, Wehrum, Stark and Schwarzer, 2015;
Corrigall and Schellenberg, 2015; Corrigall, Schellenberg and Misura,
2013; Schellenberg, 2006). Though many of these studies are
correlational, they also have made attempts to control for confounding
variables like socio-economic status and parental involvment in out of
school activities. (Corrigall et al., 2013; Degé et al., 2011a;
Schellenberg, 2006, 2011a, 2011b; Schellenberg and Mankarious, 2012).
Schellenberg notes the problem of smaller sample sizes in his review
(Corrigall and Trainor, 2011; Parbery-Clark et al., 2011; Strait,
Parbery-Clark, Hittner and Kraus, 2012) in that they normally do not
reach significance. And also references evidence that when professional
musicians are matched with non-musicians in the public, also do not seem
to see these associations. Schellenberg, 2015 which Schellenberg takes
as more evidence that it is actually just higher functioning kids that
take music lessons. Additionally, Schellenberg remains skeptical of any
sorts of causal factors regarding increases in IQ (e.g., François et
al., 2013; Moreno et al., 2009) noting methodlogical problems like how
short exposure times were, or researchers who did not hold pre-exisiting

Standing in contrast to factors that individuals do not have a much
control over such as the size of their working memory capacity or
factors related to their general fluid intelligence, most of the factors
we believe contribute to someone's ability to take melodic dictation
have to deal with factors related to training and the environment. In
fact, one of the tacit assumptions of getting a music degree revolves
around the implicitly held belief that with deliberate and attentive
practice, that an individual is able to move from novice to expertise in
their chosen domain. The idea that time invested results in beneficial
returns is probably best exemplified by work produced by ANDERS ERICKSON
1993 that suggests that performance at more elite levels has to do with
deliberate practice. Below I review literature that supports this
argument, since it's no doubt that someone has to engage in something to
be good at it.

\subsection{Sight Singing}\label{sight-singing}}

Often described as the other side of the same coin of melodic dictation,
sight singing is an area of music pedagogy research that has had sparse
attention paid to it given its prevelance in school of music curricula.
Recently \citep{fournierCognitiveStrategiesSightsinging2017a} catalouged
and categorized 14 different sub categories into four larger main
cateogories while also providing commenatary on some of the current
state of aural skills. Of the four large categories, they group them
into reading mechanisms, sight singing, readings skills acquiskiton, and
learnign support. The authors note a line of research that has
documented that university students are often unprepared to sight-read
single lines of music (Asmus, 2004; Davidson, Scripp \& Welsh, 1988;
Fournier, 2015; Thompson, 2004; Vujović \& Bogunović, 2012) even though
it is, like dictation, thought of as a means for deeper musical
understanding. (DeBellis, 2005; Karpinski, 2000; Ottman, 1956; Rogers,
2004; Scripp, 1995; Scripp \& Davidson, 1994 The authors of Fournier et.
al also note that sight-reading has been an active area of research due
to the often reported relationship that performance on sight reading
often predicts several studies have shown links between academic success
in sight-singing and predictors such as entrance tests (Harrison, 1987,
1990, 1991; Ottman, 1956; Rodeheaver, 1972; Schleuter, 1983), academic
ability (Chadwick, 1933; Harrison, 1990, 1991; Harrison, Asmus, \&
Serpe, 1994; Rodeheaver, 1972), and musical experience (Brown, 2001;
Dean, 1937; Furby, 2008; Harrison, 1990, 1991; Harrison et al., 1994;
Thostenson, 1967).

Learning to a fluid and compotent sight reader presumable bootstraps
learning other musical skills, for the same reasons aural skills are
taught in schools. Though since it's not directly related and now
starting to move away from things looking at dictation directly, time to
turn attention to the other half of the taxonomy, the musical factors.

\hypertarget{musical-factors}{%
\section{Musical Factors}\label{musical-factors}}

Moving to the other half of the taxonomy on figure X, the other big
moving part of any study that attempts to look at melodic dictaiton
would be the effects of the melody. Intuitivly, everyone has a belief
that some melodies are more difficult than others and when stated in the
null, with all melodies being equally difficult to dictate, obviously
rings true on intuition. According to the way that I was taxonomizing
it, the musical factors split into two separate, but not completley
split categories. One aspect of this would be the \textbf{structural}
aspects of a melody. These aspects would be related to discrete pitch
and time components of the melody and then any sort of parameter that
would result from a certain combintation of pitches over time such as
contour all which are range invariant. On the other hand would be what I
have termed the \textbf{experimental aspects} of a melody. The
experimental aspects of a melody would be related to aspects of a melody
that could be changed that would still make the melody be the same to a
reasonable degree like changing the tempo, key, timbre, range, or mode,
ore even elaborate ornamentation of the melody. Of course there is not a
strict deliniation between these two categories since once could imagine
enough of the experimental parameters modulated to have the melody be
categorically different. Questions of musical similarity fall have been
addressed CAMPAPERBOULIS and are beyond the scope of this study.

\hypertarget{structural}{%

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \citep{schenkerFreieSatz1935}
\end{itemize}

The notion that there is something special about the structural aspects
of music can be traced back to Leonard Meyer's \emph{Emotion and Meaning
in Music} \citep{meyerEmotionMeaningMusic1956} and has spawned a lot of
research since then. Probably one of Meyer's most prolific students was
Eugene Narmour

Whose work was expaneded upon by David Huron
\citep{huronSweetAnticipation2006} and work using expectational
frameworks in melodies was also carried on with work by Marcus Pearce
\citep{pearceAuditoryExpectationInformation2012} and Elizabeth Hellmuth
Margulis \citep{margulisModelMelodicExpectation2005}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Also schellenberg 1997
\end{itemize}

These are general models about melodic perception, though there is a
history of looking at melodic dictaiton specifically. Much of this comes
from the world of music education, though not exclusivly.

Finally turning to studies specifically looking at melodic dictation
looking specifically at musical structure, the first study to examine it
extensively was \citep{ortmannTonalDeterminantsMelodic1933}. Ortamnn
used a series of twenty five note melodies in order to examine the
effects of repetition, pitch direction, conjunct-disjunct motion
(contour), interval size, order, and chord structure, all of which he
deems to be the \emph{determinants} of an individual's ability to
dictate melodic material. This work was extended by *
\citep{taylorStrategiesMemoryShort1983} Extensin of Ortmann and looked
at more musical skills, shows ways to suggest scoring simple melodies

Although the literature is generally sparce compared to other areas of
music cognition, literature exploring the effects of structural
characteristics on memory does exist. Long found that length, tonal
structure, contour, and individual traits all contribute and also found
that structure and tonalness have significant, albeit small predictive
powers in modeling LONG 1977. Problem with long is that they eliminated
people who were bad singers for the example. This in some ways might be
problematic in that it is at odds both with intuition of representation
not being perfect mapping to singing
\citep{pfordresherPoorPitchSingingAbsence2007} and that just because
someone is bad at singing does not make them bad at representation and
the task.

also has explored melodic dictation as the main fo

Summerize and say that lots of literature has looked at this, but all a
bit primative (change that wording)

Also should mention here that clealrly not a perfect one dimensional
model where effort equals results. Simple thought expeiment that hard
work does not always equal sucess in that there are sucssfull people who
have not worked hard and very hard workers who do not experience sucess
in what they do. Additionally people need to keep up the skills they
have, insert hilarious quote here from potter not believing that people
didnt keep up their melodic dictation skills and show that they are
compartmentalized \citep{potterIdentifyingSucessfulDictation1990} This
of course does not nullify any findings on deliberate practice, but goes
to show that the whole thing is kind of complicated.

As noted above, in following studies XYZ, people have looked at musical
features before me. Since then there have been a lot further strides in
the world of computational musicology.

Since then there has been big moves in the world of computational
musicology.

  Huron with kern \citep{huronHumdrumToolkitReference1994}
\item
  music21 \citep{cuthbertMusic21ToolkitComputerAided2010}
\end{itemize}

With this new encoding and higher computer power comes ability to do
more complicated work. Meyer would have loved it.

While I reserve a longer discussion on the history of computational
musicology for the fourth chapter, relevant to this study is the
different ways that is possible to talk abstracted features of melodies.
Abstracted features of melodies largely be conceptualized as being
\textbf{static} or \textbf{dynamic}. In the above papers, tended to use
more simplisitc methods of figuring out parameters, now able to expand
using both approaches.

\hypertarget{static-views-of-computational-features-fantastic}{%
\subsubsection{Static Views of Computational Features/
FANTASTIC}\label{static-views-of-computational-features-fantastic}}

A static conceptualization of a melody takes a summary feature of it.
Helps quantify something that might be intuitive about a melody or piece
of encoded music. Do stuff like compare distribution of notes to
profiles generated for key finding algorithms (krumhansl, Albrect and
shan) Or also has measures of note density. Only problem with this is
that not known at this point to what degree the summary features can be
mapped on to human behavior.

Quintessential example of this is Feature Analsysi\ldots{}
\citep{mullensiefenFantasticFeatureANalysis2009}. FANTASTIC is software
that is capable summerizing musical material at for monophonic melodies.
In additon to computing 37 features such as contour variation,
tonalnesss, note density, note length, and measures inspired by
computational linguistics (THAT BOOK OF GERAINT), FANTASTIC also
calculates m-types (melodic-rhyhmic motives) that are based on the
frequency distributions of melodic segements found genres of music. This
is inspired by fact that repeition is key structure of music
\citep{huronSweetAnticipation2006}

Work using the FANTASTIC toolboox has been sucessful in predicting court
case decisions \citep{mullensiefenCourtDecisionsMusic2009}, predicting
chart sucesses of songs on the Beatles' \emph{Revolver}
\citep{kopiezAufSucheNach2011}, memory for old and new melodies in
signal detection experiments
\citep{mullensiefenRoleFeaturesContext2014}, memory for earworms
\citep{jakubowskiDissectingEarwormMelodic2017, williamsonEarwormsThreeAngles2012},
memorability of pop music hook \citep{balenCorpusAnalyisTools2015}. In
experimental studies, FANTASTIC has also been used to determine item
difficulty
\citep{bakerPerceptionLeitmotivesRichard2017, harrisonModellingMelodicDiscrimination2016}
and has even been the basis of the development of a computer assistted
platform for studyign memory for melodies
\citep{rainsfordMUSOSMUsicSOftware2018}

\hypertarget{dynamic}{%
\subsubsection{Dynamic}\label{dynamic}}

The other way of conceptualizing music is by using a dynamic approach.
Idea here is to take from information content SHANNON and use
unsupervised approach.

Important here to note that unlike Harrison 1994, not really appropriate
to conceptualize this as latenta bility. Very easy in statistical terms
to talk about latent variables and be able to talk about lots of
variance predictied. But problem with any sort of model like that or
model of musical sophistcation is that it has same fate as g.

QUOTES HERE FROM MS paper on latent variables

Musicianship as a concept of something ot measure when talking about
this one little task with relative lack of concrete evidence for it's
transfer, need to return back to a process model of melodic dictaiton.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

In this chapter I have first described what is melodic dictation,
Karpinki's verbal model of it, noted what the things were that were
missing from this model as a stepping off point, then went on to suggest
a taxonomy of these based on what already has done. Suggest that there
are both individual as well as musical features that are at play here.
Individual features can be either cognitive, sort of fixed, or
environmental, having do with training. Musical features can be either
structural, or experimental like how you play the melody. None of these
are necessarily hard and fast divisions, and certainly there are going
to be some interactions between any and all of the levels. Clearly a
very great question and given how much we look at it, want to know more
about this complicated network of processes. Given this laundry list of
factors, now going to explore the individual parameters in Chapter 3,
the musical chapters in 4 and 5, as well as how they would come together
in chapter 6. Also will then go into more detail about many of the
papers that I mentioned. Really there should be a chapter 7 where after
thinking about all of this I put together a computational model that
succeeds at incorporating a polymorphic view of musical training by
making a process model inspired by Karpinki that is able to be both a
research and pedagogical stepping off point for future research on
modeling melodic dictation.

  serve as cornerstone of chapter in terms of creating relevant
  literature in addition to EE course readings on WMC. Provides history
  of WMC models and notes how attention based model as opposed to
  Baddely loop might actually be better theoretical model for talking
  about fact that WMC could just be something related to attention if
  not that. Provides extensive listing on problems with chunking that
  are all relevant to music, but then also supports it. Shows that
  Miller 1956 is a generally bad citation, own author even says that in
  Miller 1989 (check and add) and says limit is probably about 4 (use
  Cowan 2001 for ctation find that). Lots of good ideas like how music
  is always serial recall, examples of how to model the process, great
  discussions on zooming out and categorical nature of music within span
  of WMC ideas.
