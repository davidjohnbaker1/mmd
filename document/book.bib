We investigated the working memory span of classical and jazz student musicians on musical and nonmusical working memory tasks. College-aged musicians completed the Bucknell Auditory Imagery Scale, followed by verbal working memory tests and musical working memory tests that included visual and auditory presentation modes and written or played recall. Participants were asked to recall the last word (or pitch) from each task after a distraction task, by writing, speaking, or playing the pitch on the piano. Jazz musicians recalled more pitches that were presented in auditory versions and recalled on the piano compared with classical musicians. Scores were positively correlated to years of jazz-playing experience. We conclude that type of training should be considered in studies of musical expertise, and that tests of musicians' cognitive skills should include domain-specific components.},

Why dictation --

Dictation is often the most difficult activity for students, for indeed the complexity of skills needed to be\\
successful is great. The students who are good at taking dictation have well-developed inner ears with\\
a strong sense of tonality, a good musical memory, a knowledge (conscious or unconscious) of common\\
patterns, and a knowledge of basic notational procedures. (Foulkes-Levy, 1997, pp. 21\textendash{}22)

TABLE THESE REVIEWS

Despite its prominence in the music curriculum, few published studies have examined dictation\\
since 2000. Only four studies were found: Gillespie (2001) surveyed aural skills instructors\\
on their scoring of dictations; Norris (2003) studied the relationship between achievement in\\
sight-singing and melodic dictation; Dooley and Deutsch (2010) asked whether having absolute\\
pitch influences performance on musical dictation; and Paney and Buonviri (2014) interviewed\\
high-school music teachers on their teaching of melodic dictation.\\
Older studies identified the following difficulty factors in the completion of dictation assessments:\\
tempo (Hofstetter, 1981), tonality (Dowling, 1978; Long, 1977; Oura \& Hatano, 1988;\\
Pembrook, 1986), size of intervals (Ortmann, 1933), conjunct versus disjunct motion\\
(Ortmann, 1933; Pembrook, 1986), length of the melody (Gephardt, 1978; Long, 1977;\\
Pembrook, 1986), number of presentations of the melody (Hofstetter, 1981; Pembrook, 1986),\\
context of the presentations (Schellenberg, 1985), participants' musical experience (Long,\\
1977; Oura \& Hatano, 1988; Schellenberg, 1985; Taylor \& Pembrook, 1983), and familiarity\\
with the style of music (Schellenberg, 1985).

Karpinski argues against Pembrook 1986 and says tha tyou can build a better memory, seems like that kind of langauge is just wrong

Weird that it used established melody and done from a recording

The survey was distributed online to a stratified random sample of 875 AP Music Theory teachers across the United States. Of these recipients, 398 participants from 49 states and the District of Columbia completed the survey, yielding a 45.5\% return rate. Results indicated that teachers preferred pitch systems that emphasized scale degree function and rhythm systems that emphasized the meter. Participants also reported the influence of the AP exam on their dictation teaching and described their need for additional instructional time and better preparation for teaching aural skills.

Four themes emerged from the interview transcripts: cognitive frameworks, processing strategies, rhythm, and course design. Participants generally confirmed established understandings of aural skills pedagogy, particularly in areas of pattern instruction, connecting aural and written theory, connecting sight-singing and dictation, incorporating scale degree function, targeting melodic ``bookends,'' focusing on the big picture, sequencing curricula, and incorporating familiar melodies. Unique to the findings of this study were participants' positive attitudes toward a standardized test and their concern for the students' psychological barriers inherent in learning aural skills. A general indifference to rhythm counting systems and a common acknowledgment of students' difficulties with rhythmic notation also was found. Recommendations for further research include a largescale survey of melodic dictation strategies taught by AP Music Theory teachers, empirical investigation of the efficacy of specific counting systems, comparison of students' reported dictation strategies and their success with dictation on the AP exam, and exploration of the influence of psychological fortitude on the dictation process.},

Forty-nine undergraduate music education majors took melodic dictations under three conditions.

A repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc analysis revealed that participants scored significantly higher when they heard the dictation immediately following the chord sequence than when they sang the preparatory pattern first. Participants may have been distracted by the additional task of singing, interfering with their focus on the ensuing dictation. They reported a variety of preparatory strategies during the silent interval condition, suggesting that dictation students may benefit from learning multiple strategies and choosing what works best for them. Future research might investigate the relationship between strategies used during dictation and strategies used just prior to dictation.

=== Strategies people use

Students may employ any of a broad range of strategies when taking dictation\\
(Karpinski, 2000), including ``chunking'' of information for efficient memory storage\\
and retrieval (Madsen \& Staum, 1983; Oura, 1991; Potter, 1990; Rogers, 2004), applying\\
contextual solf\'ege syllables or numbers to percepts for identification (McClung,\\
2001), engaging kinesthetic or visual imagery to decode pitch information (Mikumo,\\
1994; Thompson, 2004), attending to broad melodic characteristics to reinforce context\\
for the target melody (Buonviri, 2014), and employing flexible working memory\\
to analyze the melody both forward and backward in chronological sequence (Berz,\\
1995; Margulis, 2005). Some instructors teach these strategies to boost students' learning\\
and to assist them in dictation tests (Karpinski, 2000; Paney \& Buonviri, 2013).

~

Demorest and Clements (2007), for example, found that\\
providing a tonal context may improve performance on pitch-matching tasks.

~

VERY LOW ETA SQUARED AND NOT PAIR WISE SCORING

Pembrook (1987) found that attempting to sing an entire dictation melody from\\
memory before notating it was generally counterproductive for students because they\\
couldn't sing the melody correctly.

~

EM: Research has shown that dictation students employ a number of different strategies\\
to decode pitch and rhythm efficiently and accurately (Mikumo, 1994; Thompson,\\
2004).

WHY DICTATION

Melodic dictation plays a crucial role in music education\\
because it serves as one of the ways to assess students'\\
cognitive transfer capabilities between the visual\\
and aural domains.

~

(1) Participants are highly skilled at directing their\\
attention during dictation,

(2) participants prioritize\\
tasks carefully during each listening of a dictation, and\\
(3) participants skillfully coordinate a variety of musical\\
and problem-solving skills to complete dictations\\
successfully.

Participants use deductive reasoning (in line w Karpinski 2000)

Telesco (1991) described the development of aural\\
analytical skills as ``the wedding of the aural experience\\
to abstract musical constructs'' (p. 179).

These data are consistent with the framework of Margulis's\\
(2005) model of melodic expectancy, highlighting the\\
importance of both forward and reverse time in listeners'\\
perceptions of, and responses to, music.

Researchers might also\\
pursue experimental comparisons of various specific strategies\\
as measured by dictation scores, and longitudinal studies\\
of personal strategy development by dictation students.}

Given the intrinsic sequential organization of musical material, the study of STM for musical information may be particularly informative about serial order retention processes and their domaingenerality. The present experiment examined serial order STM for verbal and musical sequences in participants with no advanced musical expertise and experienced musicians. Serial order STM for verbal information was assessed via a serial order reconstruction task for digit sequences. In the musical domain, serial order STM was assessed using a novel melodic sequence reconstruction task maximizing the retention of tone order information. We observed that performance for the verbal and musical tasks was characterized by sequence length as well as primacy and recency effects. Serial order errors in both tasks were characterized by similar transposition gradients and ratios of fillin:infill errors. These effects were observed for both participant groups, although the transposition gradients and ratios of fill-in/infill errors showed additional specificities for musician participants in the musical task. The data support domain-general serial order STM effects but also suggest the existence of additional, domain-specific effects.

=== WHY DO AURAL

Researchers\\
have found that student musicians' listening skills help them to improve instrumental\\
performance (Duke \& Simmons, 2006; Hewitt, 2001; Morrison, Trevi\~no, \& Sielert,2008), match pitch accurately (e.g., Demorest \& Clements, 2007), take dictation efficiently\\
(Buonviri, 2014; Potter, 1990), conduct effectively (e.g., Waggoner, 2011),\\
compose original tunes (e.g., Kennedy, 2002), and learn to improvise (e.g., Hickey,\\
2009). Therefore, the ways students acquire and use listening skills may strongly\\
influence their overall development as musicians.

problem is that what is meant by learning to listen

Waggoner (2011) discovered that undergraduate music majors were\\
less adept at error detection when conducting a piece than when listening to a recording\\
of it.

Pembrook 1986 -- 7 - 11 Notes (Better with IC) 

These results suggest that aural skills accuracy\\
decreases as musical complexity increases, confirming findings by Byo (1997).

"a psychological theory of music is successful to the extent that it reflects perception. Musical perception is pluralistic and fluid; listeners make use of multiple cognitive frameworks and shift their strategies from one moment to the next. A psychological model of perception needs to embody these charac- teristics. But there is no reason why music theory should be like this. When a theorist analyzes a piece of music, [he or] she is taking up an interpretive stance in relation to it ... From this point of view, the psychologist's perceptual model is totally inappropriate because ... 'the resultant theoretical construct will be devoid of critical content: It cannot challenge our pre-formed responses because it sets out to reproduce them.' The aim of music theory, then, is to go beyond perception. In fact, you might put the point polemically and say that, from the music-theoretical point of view, an analysis can have value only to the extent that it deviates from perception. . . ." (Cook, 1994, p. 89)

One problem that quickly became apparent in the transcripts has to do with a general lack of focus in defining educational objectives in aural training

~

The broadly stated goal in the main- stream is a well developed "inner ear"; the primary specific objective is good relative pitch and a solid sense of tonality, described as a clear aural sense of scale-step. The primary - almost sole - choice of classroom/lab activities is traditional sight-singing and dictation. In the secondary stream, the broadly stated goal is an amalgam of aural mastery and performance skill: aural training and performance are viewed as inseparable, but for varying reasons. Classroom and lab activities vary widely, depending on these reasons.

Similarly, there just aren't many music theorists who express a deep interest in aural training, and are willing and able to get their hands dirty conducting experimental research to test their ideas

The second part then examines the skills involved in reading and performing music. It looks at such physical skills as vocal production and eye movements and at such complex integrated tasks as sight-singing transpositions and modulations. Throughout the book the author presents these skills in their musical contexts and emphasizes their roles in the general development of musicality.Aural Skills Acquisition builds important bridges between music theory, cognitive psychology, and pedagogy. It subjects ideas from music theory to the rigors of psychological testing and combines findings from the psychology of learning with ideas and methods of contemporary music theory.

  abstract = {The idea of one's memory "filling up" is a humorous misconception of how memory in general is thought to work; it actually has no capacity limit. However, the idea of a "full brain" makes more sense with reference to working memory, which is the limited amount of information a person can hold temporarily in an especially accessible form for use in the completion of almost any challenging cognitive task. This groundbreaking book explains the evidence supporting Cowan's theoretical proposal about working memory capacity, and compares it to competing perspectives. Cognitive psychologists profoundly disagree on how working memory is limited: whether by the number of units that can be retained (and, if so, what kind of units and how many?), the types of interfering material, the time that has elapsed, some combination of these mechanisms, or none of them. The book assesses these hypotheses and examines explanations of why capacity limits occur, including vivid biological, cognitive, and evolutionary accounts. The book concludes with a discussion of the practical importance of capacity limits in daily life. Incorporating the latest from the recent surge in research into working memory capacity limits and the remarkable new insights provided by neuroimaging techniques, this book serves as an invaluable resource for all memory researchers and is accessible to a wide range of readers.

Jazz musicians recalled more pitches that were presented in auditory versions and recalled on the piano compared with classical musicians.

Given the dynamic nature of SMS, we hypothesised that individual differences in working memory and auditory imagery\textemdash{}both fluid cognitive processes\textemdash{}would predict SMS at two levels: (1) mean absolute asynchrony (a measure of synchronisation error) and (2) anticipatory timing (i.e., predicting, rather than reacting to beat intervals). In Experiment 1, participants completed two working memory tasks, four auditory imagery tasks, and an SMS-tapping task. Hierarchical regression models were used to predict SMS performance, with results showing dissociations among imagery types in relation to mean absolute asynchrony, and evidence of a role for working memory in anticipatory timing. In Experiment 2, a new sample of participants completed an expressive timing perception task to examine the role of imagery in perception without action. Results suggest that imagery vividness is important for perceiving and control is important for synchronising with irregular but ecologically valid musical time series. Working memory is implicated in synchronising by anticipating events in the series.},

The so-called ``Mozart effect'' actually refers to two relatively distinct phenomena. One concerns short-term increases in spatial abilities that are said to occur from listening to music composed by Mozart. The other refers to the possibility that formal training in music yields nonmusical benefits. A review of the relevant findings indicates that the shortterm effect is small and unreliable. Moreover, when it is evident, it can be explained by between-condition differences in the listener's mood or levels of cognitive arousal. By contrast, the effect of music lessons on nonmusical aspects of cognitive development is still an open question. Several studies have reported positive associations between formal music lessons and abilities in nonmusical (e.g., linguistic, mathematical, and spatial) domains.

The participants were 118 adults (Study 1) and 167 10- to 12-year-old children (Study 2). We collected demographic information and measured cognitive ability and the Big Five personality dimensions. As in previous research, cognitive ability was associated with musical involvement even when demographic variables were controlled statistically. Novel findings indicated that personality was associated with musical involvement when demographics and cognitive ability were held constant, and that openness-to-experience was the personality dimension with the best predictive power. These findings reveal that: (1) individual differences influence who takes music lessons and for how long, (2) personality variables are at least as good as cognitive variables at predicting music training, and (3) future correlational studies of links between music training and non-musical ability should account for individual differences in personality.},
