  abstract = {Jazz musicians rely on different skills than do classical musicians for successful performances. We investigated the working memory span of classical and jazz student musicians on musical and nonmusical working memory tasks. College-aged musicians completed the Bucknell Auditory Imagery Scale, followed by verbal working memory tests and musical working memory tests that included visual and auditory presentation modes and written or played recall. Participants were asked to recall the last word (or pitch) from each task after a distraction task, by writing, speaking, or playing the pitch on the piano. Jazz musicians recalled more pitches that were presented in auditory versions and recalled on the piano compared with classical musicians. Scores were positively correlated to years of jazz-playing experience. We conclude that type of training should be considered in studies of musical expertise, and that tests of musicians' cognitive skills should include domain-specific components.},

Bascially people need to take into account WHAT kind of training people are getting.

This article supports view that things should be looked at in terms of polymorphism.}

length, tonal structure, contour, individual all contribute.

Previous Structure and Tonalness are good predictors!

In experiment had musical background as a predictor, but they elimnated people who were bad at singing

Musical characteristics and features predict melodic memory scores.

* Insights from Ortmann 1933????

In addition to Ortmann variables

- Musical Traning

- Serial Position and Length

- Music Context

- Tonality

-Transposition

-Expectancy

-Octave Displacement

-Melodic Contour

Study also suggests how to score simple melodies

Small study with no statisical analysis

Interesting methdology, but they bascially say that the retention model is better with very shady analysis~
