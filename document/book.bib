  abstract = {Jazz musicians rely on different skills than do classical musicians for successful performances. We investigated the working memory span of classical and jazz student musicians on musical and nonmusical working memory tasks. College-aged musicians completed the Bucknell Auditory Imagery Scale, followed by verbal working memory tests and musical working memory tests that included visual and auditory presentation modes and written or played recall. Participants were asked to recall the last word (or pitch) from each task after a distraction task, by writing, speaking, or playing the pitch on the piano. Jazz musicians recalled more pitches that were presented in auditory versions and recalled on the piano compared with classical musicians. Scores were positively correlated to years of jazz-playing experience. We conclude that type of training should be considered in studies of musical expertise, and that tests of musicians' cognitive skills should include domain-specific components.},

A repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc analysis revealed that participants scored significantly higher when they heard the dictation immediately following the chord sequence than when they sang the preparatory pattern first. Participants may have been distracted by the additional task of singing, interfering with their focus on the ensuing dictation. They reported a variety of preparatory strategies during the silent interval condition, suggesting that dictation students may benefit from learning multiple strategies and choosing what works best for them.

=== Strategies people use

Students may employ any of a broad range of strategies when taking dictation\\
(Karpinski, 2000), including ``chunking'' of information for efficient memory storage\\
and retrieval (Madsen \& Staum, 1983; Oura, 1991; Potter, 1990; Rogers, 2004), applying\\
contextual solf\'ege syllables or numbers to percepts for identification (McClung,\\
2001), engaging kinesthetic or visual imagery to decode pitch information (Mikumo,\\
1994; Thompson, 2004), attending to broad melodic characteristics to reinforce context\\
for the target melody (Buonviri, 2014), and employing flexible working memory\\
to analyze the melody both forward and backward in chronological sequence (Berz,\\
1995; Margulis, 2005). Some instructors teach these strategies to boost students' learning\\
and to assist them in dictation tests (Karpinski, 2000; Paney \& Buonviri, 2013).

~

Demorest and Clements (2007), for example, found that\\
providing a tonal context may improve performance on pitch-matching tasks.

~

VERY LOW ETA SQUARED AND NOT PAIR WISE SCORING

Pembrook (1987) found that attempting to sing an entire dictation melody from\\
memory before notating it was generally counterproductive for students because they\\
couldn't sing the melody correctly.

~

EM: Research has shown that dictation students employ a number of different strategies\\
to decode pitch and rhythm efficiently and accurately (Mikumo, 1994; Thompson,\\
2004).

``chunking'' of bits of information into larger pieces\\

WHY DICTATION

Melodic dictation plays a crucial role in music education\\
because it serves as one of the ways to assess students'\\
cognitive transfer capabilities between the visual\\
and aural domains.

~

(1) Participants are highly skilled at directing their\\
attention during dictation,

(2) participants prioritize\\
tasks carefully during each listening of a dictation, and\\
(3) participants skillfully coordinate a variety of musical\\
and problem-solving skills to complete dictations\\
successfully.

Participants use deductive reasoning (in line w Karpinski 2000)

Telesco (1991) described the development of aural\\
analytical skills as ``the wedding of the aural experience\\
to abstract musical constructs'' (p. 179).

These data are consistent with the framework of Margulis's\\
(2005) model of melodic expectancy, highlighting the\\
importance of both forward and reverse time in listeners'\\
perceptions of, and responses to, music.

Researchers might also\\
pursue experimental comparisons of various specific strategies\\
as measured by dictation scores, and longitudinal studies\\
of personal strategy development by dictation students.}

Given the intrinsic sequential organization of musical material, the study of STM for musical information may be particularly informative about serial order retention processes and their domaingenerality. The present experiment examined serial order STM for verbal and musical sequences in participants with no advanced musical expertise and experienced musicians. Serial order STM for verbal information was assessed via a serial order reconstruction task for digit sequences. In the musical domain, serial order STM was assessed using a novel melodic sequence reconstruction task maximizing the retention of tone order information. We observed that performance for the verbal and musical tasks was characterized by sequence length as well as primacy and recency effects. Serial order errors in both tasks were characterized by similar transposition gradients and ratios of fillin:infill errors. These effects were observed for both participant groups, although the transposition gradients and ratios of fill-in/infill errors showed additional specificities for musician participants in the musical task. The data support domain-general serial order STM effects but also suggest the existence of additional, domain-specific effects.

=== WHY DO AURAL

Researchers\\
have found that student musicians' listening skills help them to improve instrumental\\
performance (Duke \& Simmons, 2006; Hewitt, 2001; Morrison, Trevi\~no, \& Sielert,2008), match pitch accurately (e.g., Demorest \& Clements, 2007), take dictation efficiently\\
(Buonviri, 2014; Potter, 1990), conduct effectively (e.g., Waggoner, 2011),\\
compose original tunes (e.g., Kennedy, 2002), and learn to improvise (e.g., Hickey,\\
2009). Therefore, the ways students acquire and use listening skills may strongly\\
influence their overall development as musicians.

problem is that what is meant by learning to listen

Waggoner (2011) discovered that undergraduate music majors were\\
less adept at error detection when conducting a piece than when listening to a recording\\
of it.

Pembrook 1986 -- 7 - 11 Notes (Better with IC) 

These results suggest that aural skills accuracy\\
decreases as musical complexity increases, confirming findings by Byo (1997).
