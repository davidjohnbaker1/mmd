# Theoretical Background and Rationale {#intro}

## What is melodic dictation? and Why?

Melodic dictation is the process in which an individual is able to hear a melody, retain it in memory, and then use their knowledge of Western musical notation to recreate the mental image of the melody on paper in a limited time frame.
For many, becoming profiecent at this task is at the core of developing one's aural skills.
Presumably the reason that melodic dictation is so highly valued in music pedagogical circles is because that time spent learning to do this highly complex set of mental gymnastics results in increases in near transfer abilities^[since at no point after being in an Aural Skills setting would some one require one to write down a melody on paper within a limited time frame.] that are of great benefit to the student once they leave the classroom.
Melodic dictation is only one of many skills that are taught and assesed in Schools of Music and this skill is normally taught in the context of an Aural Skills class.
On a poetic level, the idea of aural skills class is to be able to make one's ear better, and this is kind of rationale has existed in music circles for at least the past 150 years.

In his highly influenctial book _Aural Skills Acquisition: The Development of Listening, Reading, and Performing Skills in College-Level Musicians_, Gary @karpinskiAuralSkillsAcquisition2000 documents this deeply held belief in music pedagogy circles by listing poetic adages from romantic composer Robert Schumann in the mid 19th century through music educator Charles Elliott in the opening of his text, thus providing concrete examples of this belief that perfecting one's aural skills, or _ear_, more colloquially, is a highly sought after advanced skill. 
After documenting many of of these, he asserts that the goal of improving one's ear is to escape from thinking about music to thinking in music.

A lot of the reasons that I think we do this are introspective and anecdotal, but the thing is this is ubiquitous.
There, as this literature review will show, is not a lot of great emperical evidence looking directly at melodic dictation, so then to claim that there are huge transfers to be gained from learning how to do it would be underwhelming.
More recently people have noted that the rationale for why we teach this probably deserves more critique with researchers like Klonoski raising important questions like "What specific deficiency is revelaned with an incorrect reponse in melodic dictaiton settings?" [@klonoskiImprovingDictationAuralSkills2006] and even earlier researchers like Potter being baffled by the fact that many musicians do no actually keep up with their melodic dictation abilities after the classs ends POTTER QUOTE.
Even a simple thought experiment using the old double dissicoation thign that htey love in neuroscience where you could imagine both situations where someone was probably a very good musician, but not that great at melodic dictation, or the converse where someone might be very good at melodic dictation, but is not that good of a musician (whatever that means) would indicate that there is probably not that strong of a casusal link between dictation abilities as measured by grades in an aural skills class and the infinite possiblities of musical activities that are even possible.  

This is a pretty grim introduction, but want to leave no dark elephant in the closet. 
Rationale for learning to do this is often tacit and assumed and passed down over time, and despite the above is still good.
All that said, there have been people who have tried to put the argument for melodic dictation into more concerete terms.
In her textbook _Practical Ear Training_ Janet McLoud McGaughy notes that

> qualified musicians must develop reading, singing, and notational skills in order to achieve acuity of aural perception and to make effective use of that acuity" (p. i)."

which makes the point that the development of ear training is about developing acuity in aural percepiton which then is then transfered over for other musical activity.

UTAH MAN SAYS IT BEST WHEN HE SAYS 

UTAH MAN QUOTE

Stuff about the truly aural skills.

At a deeper level, when we are teaching aural skills, we are teaching people to be better listeners and given all of the possible things that we can look at with aural skills, melodic dictaiton is great because there is a lot of great literature from the world of music perception, less to worry about than harmonic dictation, and is ubiquitous probably because NASM requires people to have to learn how to do this to get a music degree from an accredited music school.

Karpinski devotes an entire chapter to melodic dictation in his book, note that it's a focal point, addressed in the majority of aural skills textbooks, and because of this it starts out with a really good jumping off point because he has done a lot of the preliminary work./

OK GOOD NOW I HAVE AT LEAST RATIONALIZED WHY 

In addition to his bifurcation of arual skills into Listening and Reading/Performing skills, Karpinski devotes an entire chapter to the study of melodic dictation, providing a verbal model for how he describes the component parts and process as a whole.

### Describe process

* Need to talk about chunking 

Karpinski's chapter on Aural Skills culminates in a flowchart, Figure 3.1 in his textbook reporduced below, that schematizes how he believes the process to work. 

Upon listenign to a melody,

### Karpinski schematic of it (as verbal model, problems)

Karpinski's schmatization of melodic dictation can generally be conceptualized as process that consists of the following four steps:

* Hear
* Remember
* Understand
* Notate

For Karpinski, most of the cognitive action happens in the understand process, which is the only subprocess that he groups into two differnt sub-processes: one foo understanding the temporal aspects of music (e.g. pulse, meter, rhythmic proportions) and another for understand the pitch parameters (e.g. tonci, scale degree of starting pitch, scale degree of subsequnt pitches).
The process is looped over with every hearing, and Karpinski suggests that the listener will use some sort of chunking of melodies in order to hear the melody and to then notate it. 

#### Verbal model, has problems, OK for pedagogy

As a verbal model, Karpinski's model of dictation makes sense and breaks down a very complicated cognitive process into discrete, sequential steps.
This model, whether or not Karpinski intented it to be an actual cognitive model, I don't know, assumes serial processing of information and does not specify any of the actual parameters for each of the steps.
This model serves as a great stepping off point for this dissertation, and its good for me that he didn't actually specificy any of the actual parameters, he just said certain things happen and gave an approximate order of the whole thing.
He talks about a lot of the parameters leading up to it all,
Even talks about things like representation and other paramters that are going to influence it all.
Did not attempt to pin down any of the exact parameters of his model, but this is just me wanting to forshadown Chapter 6 where I take each of these issues and implement them in a computational model. 
While covering many bases, one of the problems with using a verbal model as opposed to a computational one is that by not specificying exaclty what happens when and how everything is represented, the model can manifest itself in a multiude of different ways.

Take for example the often cited model of working memory by Alan Baddely and Grahm Hitch which posits a modular view of workign memory capcacity [@baddeleyWorkingMemory1974].
As discussed in CITE, although the model only has X amount of distinctive systems, the fact that they left it to be a verbal model of memory, and did not tack down exactly how each parameter functions, when built as computational model actually ends up yielding 156 different models. 
While I will reseve discussing how many possible models might exists as derrived from the Karpinski for Chapter 6, it is suffice to say that clearly establishing the degree to which part of the model contributes in concrete way only helps with furthering the literature.


#### Verbal model, no individual differnces tho literture to suggest

One thing that is lacking in the Karpinski model are any sort of individual differences.
A wealth of literature from music perception and cognition suggests that musical training has effects on how people perform in musical tasks TRAIN OF CITATIONS HERE.
Given the evidence that individual differences play a role here, there should be some sort of way of incorporating them into a model of melodic dictation. 

#### Computational model to be introduced

From an empirical standpoint, both the task as well as the process of melodic dictation as depicted by Karpinksi resemble something that can be turned into an experiment, as well as a computational model. 
This dissertation seeks to explore the degree to which methodologies from cognitive psychology and computational musicology are able to further this literature and take the next logical step in terms of understanding aural skills. 


* Need to talk about extractive listening in the melodic dictation process
* Also need to talk about how if you look at melodic dictation as active process... helpfullllllll?


Find Karpinksi 1990 on his model ......

Given work from Karpinksi, we know that the following factors play a role in this extractive listening process 

* Hearing -- actual playing of melody
* Short Term Melodic Memory 
* Extractive Listening 
* Chunking 
* Meter and Rhythm
* Rhythm Solimization and Understanding
* Pitch -- representation and contour, solimization
* Notation -- clealry need to know how it all works 
* Tempo
* Length and Number of Playing
* Duration between Playing 

* he puts forth chunking formula on page 99

* is it OK to say that he leaves out difficulty of melody
* is it OK to say that he leaves out individual differences

* is rhthmic solimization just the same as LTM 

### Clearly this is psychological problem with different item level difficulty   

When viewed from a pedagogical stand point, espcielaly given how litle time people have, it would basically be impossible to attend to each of these things in a gradient fashion in the standard 15 week semester that people have. 
When people teach this, need to rely very much on intuition and basically adjust to the level of your class and syllabus and whatever on the fly in order to convey the most amount of musical materials possible. 

Conversly, when viewed from an experimental standpoint, each of the above mentioned processes is bascially an experimental parameter waiting to be investigated.
Additionally, the process that is put forth by KARPINSKI 1999 provides a stepping off point for positing some sort of comutational model.
Going to add substatinally to it in that going to take into account both how difficulty the melodies are, something we  have intiutive understanding of, but could be operationalized, and also going to try to model individual differences based on factors that prior literature would suggest are different in individuals and should be considered in any sort of modeling going forward. 
In addition to these above parameters discussed by Karpinski, now review other factors that could then contribute to this process.

#### Individual Factors to contribute 

From an individual stand point, can bifurcate factors broadly into *cognitive factors*, or factors of people that are relatively consistent over people or basically like fixed effects things (use definiton of what is a fixed effect); and the other side of this would be things that would have to be delt with that change with training and exposure. 
Going to refer to this second set of things as *Environmental* factors. 
Is there a better way to talk about this as nature vs nurture.
Addiitonally need to then mention that there are of course epigenitic factors where both of these parameters might interact with one another. 
For example, might then imagine that someone with higher cognitive abilitty, lots of training that was put forward by their parents, as well as tons of musical training, and personality traits that are more likely to learn more (daniels paper on that) might be different in terms of resutls than someone with lower cognitive abilities, no training, low SES, and a general inclination not to even take music lessons. 
While obvious, what will eventually be of interest is the degree to which each of these things contributes to the final models.
Also gives us a better idea about pedagogy and what not. 

#### Musical factors to contribute

In addition to differences at the individual level, there are also musical level characteristics.
In this category it is also worth taxonimizing the musical characterstics into two categories as well.
On one hand we have the structural aspects of the melody itself.
These are aspects of the melody that would remain invariant when written down on a score.
Reading from left to right, would be things like range, key, time signature, intervals, amount of notes, contour of the melody, tonal properties, standardized note density.
Then the other side would be musical features that I am going to deem as experiemntal features of the melody.
These are aspects of the structure of hte melody that you can then warp within the context of a melodic dictiation such as tempo, which then refelcts note density, timbral qualities, how many times the melody is played, the space between hearings. 
This is not a categorial divide, while I put something like range as key of the melody as structural, you could imagine that you could have hte same interval invariant structure of a melody , perhaps Twinkle, Twinkle little star begginging on C2 noteated in bass cleff, but then imagine the the same "melody" being played two and a half octaves up on F#4, and transposed to minor and played quicker leading ot a phenomenologically similar experience, but not the same.
I taxonimze them early on, but again note that a model of this should be able withstand the multitude of patterns that exist. 

#### Make a Model of them 

Given all of these factors that then go into the melodic dictaiton process, the remainder of this chapter will detail previous reserach that has gone into each of these factors.
Talking about each one will provide rationale for why it should be further investigated if we are to better understand melodic dictation.
Beginning with *cognitive factors* two levels, then go on to talk about *musical features*.
After discussing both and their two subcompoents as I have taxonimzed them, offer a brief discussion on how it's bad to think about these as just latent abilities.
Instead talk about thinking about modeling melodic dictaiton, in terms of ACTUAL MODELING, as polymorphic conceptualization of aural skills. 
This is important because how we talk about and model things reflects or values and often it will get in the way of stuff.

## Individual Factors

### Cognitive

Research from the cognitive psychology literature suggests that individuals differ in their percetual and cognitive abilities in ways that are not easily influenced by short term-training (cite) and that these abilities, when investigated on a large scale are predictive of a wealth of human behavior from RICHIE CITATIONS.
If literature exists that suggests that cognitive abilites are sucessful predictors of things related to something like academic achievement, it worth investigating the extent that these abilities might play when modeling melodic dictation.
This is also important to understand because if we were to find out that something as simple as general fluid intelligence was a strong predictor in musical tasks that we are grading people on, it would be pretty unfair to do since we are then basiclly grading people on genetic factors beyond their control, as well as environmental factors shown to have some sort of effect on IQ (Richie paper again).
Recenlty there has been a surge of interest in this area (nancy rogers, LVH, utah guy, karinkski icmpc, form at SMT) probably due to the fact that educators are picking up on the fact that cognitive abilities are powerful predictors and need to be understood since they ineveitably will play a role in pedagogical settings. 

Before diving into a discussion regarding differences in cognitive ability, I should note that sometimes ideas regarding differnces in cognitive ability been hostily recieved (citation against people talking about IQ) and for good reasons.
Research in this area can and has been taken advantage to further dangerous ideologies (Bell Curve), but often arguments that assert meaningful differences in cognitiev abilites between groups are founed on statistical misunderstandings and have been debunked in other literature (measure of man).
With that cleared out of the way, it is very hard to mantain a scientific commitment to the theory of evolution (Darwin) and not expect variation in all aspects of human behavior, with cognition falling within that umbrella.

Attempting to measure aspects of cognition go back over a century.
Even before concepts of intelligence were posited by Charles Spearman and his conception of _g_ (Spearman, 1904), scientists were intersted in finding links between an individual's mental abilities and some sort of physical manifestation.
This area of research was pretty dark and kind of implicitly was all about validating preconceutalized ideas that people had on the superiority of peoples, with white dudes always comign out on top.
For example, THIS GUY WHO TRIED TO QUANTIFY GREATNESS
Also this guy who basically measured people's skull sizes.
But of course this stuff is not meaningful at all, especially when the dependent variable in this was so subjective and constrained by a culture where one ruling people (white dudes) had all the power.

I only mention this because this line of thinking was co-opted by the American herediterian school of IQ (page 187 in Gould), where people that were after the same sort of idea (superiority of white people) basically took ideas of Alfred Binet, one of the first people to begin to systematically investigate cognitive ability in children at request of the french governement so that children who were, what today we would call learning disabled, could be identified and given special attention.
Binet also took a lot of inspiration from Broca, WHO I TALK ABOUT ABOVE ON SKULL SIZE.

Bient was the initial developer of the idea of an intelligence quotient (divide mental age by chronological age then multiply by 100) and provided one of the first ways to attempt to measure something that was not capable of being manifested in the phsysical world. 
Around the same time have people like Cyrial Burt and Charles spearmean developing new theories of intelligence based on the reification factor analysis and calling it g that is based on solving problems without prior knowledge. 

sentence here about g and the postive manifold

Of course took this aside to talk about that basiclaly Binet and Spearman's ideologies about what can be measusred still represent two of the largest schools of thought on ways to meausre cognitive ability.
On one hand there idea that cognitive abilities are based upon a steady growth of incoming information that someone is able to manipulate once they retrieve from long term memory, the other hand is that in addition to that there is some sort of construct in the mind that differs between people that can singularly refelect their intelligence, often referred to as g. 

Basic assumption is that there is something in the brain here where differences will lead to different behaviors. 
Without detailing entire histories of this line of thought, Binet basically turned into an argument for general crystalized intelligence, or DEFINITINO HERE (citation).
The Spearman, Burt strain of thought evolved into the _g_ school, and recent reserach has suggested that the concept of _g_ basically is statistcally equnivlient to idea conceptualized as general fluid intelligence (cite that in POT).
Both of these constructs are powerful predictors on a large scale, but they don't explain the entire picture.

Another large area in the field of cognitve psychology is the area of working memory capacity.
As noted in Cowan 2005, what the term refers depends on the framework that is being used, but generally refers to the amount of information that can be acvtively held in concsionus representation, akin to short term memory, but with some important caveats discssed below. 
In additon to concepts of intelligence, be it Gf or Gc, the working memory capcity literature has done a lot of the heavy theoretical lifting, and after reviewing it we will have a much better idea of how once you decide about how you conceptualize it, then it's helpful. 

Given this brief background on cognitive ability, going to now dive deeper into both working memory capcity, as well as general fluid intelligence (avoid calling it _g_ for good reasons) and review literature where these have been discussed as they relate to research on music perception, thus being related to melodic dictation, a skill that you need to percieve music to be able to do? 

### Working Memory Capacity

As noted by Berz 1994, tasks of melodic dictation are basically tasks of working memory.

* [@berzWorkingMemoryMusic1995]

Quoting from him directly 

> Here is his quote

Clearly, would be worth understanding the concept at a deeper level since clealry they have done a lot of great work on the topic. 
Adoptiong chrnological take of the history of research the heavy hitters are 
* Attkinson and Shriff 
* Miller 1956 and why that is a bad idea
* Baddely and Hitch 
* Nelson Cowan + need for complex span

For reasons discussed on p 18 of cowan 2005 and page 42 , choose to adopot a Cowanian view where WMC is basically the window of attention.
Additinally it's worth noting initially that you can't directly apply these frameworks to memory for musical material because after reading page 109 in Cowan, important to note that all melodies appear in serial order. 
To make analogous task based on something like complex span tasks, would need to take certain set of notes and then always a finate setb be played back in arandom order (see chatper 3)

So while for my purposes, I will refer to it as listed on page 1 of Cowan 2005:
  
  > [Working memory capacity] refers to the relativly small amount of information that one can hold in mind, attend to, or, technically speaking, maintain in a rapidly accesible state at one time. The term working is mean to indicate that meantal work requres use of such informaiton. (p.1])

But in the literature below I comment on which definitional framework is used if relevant to the reporting of it all.

#### Papers that suggest WMC plays a role

### General Intelligence

As discussed above gf has a long history, some good some bad.
Thing is that it can be really predictive of many things and people def do try incoproate it into music research.

One of the big problems with this is establishing effects of causality looking at music.
Could be that factors outside of music play a role like persanal views of ability (Daniel paper), socio economic status, and personality.
And field is even big enough to have null results (include that catty comment of glenn schellenberg)

* Stuff on mozart effect 
* Whole chapter from Schellenberg
* Swaminithan papers

#### Papers that suggest GF plays a role

### Environmental 

### Long term memory and corpus with implicit

Standing in contrast to factors that individuals do not have a much control over such as the size of their working memory capapacity or factors related to their general fluid intelligence, most of the factors we believe contribute to someone's abililty to take melodic dictation have to deal with factors related to training and the envirionment.
In fact, one of the tacit assumptions of getting a music degree revolves around the implictly held belief that with delibrate and attentive practice, that an individual is able to move from novice to expertise in their chosen domain.
The idea that time invested results in beneficial returns is probably best exemplified by work produced by ANDERS ERICKSON 1993 that suggests that performance at more elite levels has to do with delibreate practice.
Below I review literature that supports this argument, since it's no doubt that someone has to engage in something to be good at it.

### Caveat about dilberate practice and talent

Also should mention here that clealrly not a perfect one dimensional model where effort equals results.
Simple thought expeiment that hard work does not always equal sucess in that there are sucssfull people who have not worked hard and very hard workers who do not experience sucess in what they do.
Additionally people need to keep up the skills they have, insert hilarious quote here from potter not believing that people didnt keep up their melodic dictaiton skills and show that they are compartmentalized [@potterIdentifyingSucessfulDictation1990]
This of course does not nullify any findings on delibreate practice, but goes to show that the whole thing is kind of complicated.

FROM FANTSTIC

Phrase summary features that summarise the content of a melodic phrase, conceptually similar to the features that Steinbeck (1982) proposed but incorporating as well recent knowledge and techniques on tonality induction and melodic contour.
Repetition features that measure the repetitiveness of short melodic-rhythmic sequences or motives (called m-types) which are the building blocks of melodies. These features are mainly inspired by characteristic text constants from computational linguistics that describe the frequency distribution of words in written text (see Baayen, 2001).
Features based on the frequencies and frequency densities of phrase summary features in a corpus of pop music. These features build on the assumption that the frequency with which melodic features appear in real music are very important for music cognition (Huron, 2006).
Features that are based on the corpus-derived frequencies of m-types as building blocks of melodies. These features are motivated by the important role that word frequencies play in text information retrieval and text categorisation (Landau et al., 2007) and verbal memory (Tse and Altarriba, 2007).

### Brief discussion on Individual and Envirnoment Interactions

Thinking about how all of these parameters contributes makes sense to a certain degree
Could imagene the extereme case of each of these either helping or hindering someone's ability to think.
Additionally could be the point that things interact with each other.
And on top of that we have the idea about levels of Explanation

## Modeling and Polymorphism of Ability 

Important here to note that unlike Harrison 1994, not really appropriate to conceptualize this as latenta bility.
Very easy in statistical terms to talk about latent variables and be able to talk about lots of variance predictied.
But problem with any sort of model like that or model of musical sophistcation is that it has same fate as g.

QUOTES HERE FROM MS paper on latent variables 

Musicianship as a concept of something ot measure when talking about this one little task with relative lack of concrete evidence for it's transfer, need to return back to a process model of melodic dictaiton.

### Polymophic, component process makes you think about things in models

Going to say here that LVs are bad and that need to adopt a more polymorphic view of musicianship as advocated by

## Conclusions

In this chapter I have first described what is melodic dictation, Karpinki's verbal model of it, noted what the things were that were missing from this model as a stepping off point, then went on to suggest a taxnomy of these based on what already has done. 
Suggest that there are both individual as well as musical features that are at play here.
Individual features can be either cognitive, sort of fixed, or environemental, having do with training.
Musical features can be either structural, or experimental like how you play the melody.
None of these are nessecariy hard and fast divisions, and certainly there are going to be some interactions between any and all of the levels.
Clearly a very great question and given how much we look at it, want to know more about this complicated network of proccesses. 
Given this laundry list of factors, now going to explore the individual parameters in Chapter 3, the musical chapters in 4 and 5, as well as how they would come together in chapter 6.
Also will then go into more detail about many of the papers that I mentioned. 
Really there should be a chapter 7 where after thinking about all of this I put together a computational model that succcedes at incorporating a polymorphic view of musical trianing by making a proces model inspired by Karpinki that is able to be both a research and pedagogical stepping off point for futre reserach on modeling melodic dictation.


### Clearly we have factors that are thought to contribute, need to investigate them in full with each chapter
### Not before first looking at why we are doing it in the first place (--transition to Chapter 2)
