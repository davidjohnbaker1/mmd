# Theoretical Background and Rationale {#intro}

## What is melodic dictation? 
### Describe process
### Karpinski schematic of it (as verbal model, problems)
#### Verbal model, has problems, OK for pedagogy
#### Verbal model, no individual differnces tho literture to suggest
#### Computational model to be introduced
### Clearly this is psychological problem with different item level difficulty   
#### Individual Factors to contribute 
#### Musical factors to contribute
#### Make a Model of them 
## Cognitive Factors (MT and it selection bias)
### Working Memory Capacity
#### Papers that suggest WMC plays a role
### General Fluid Intelligence
#### Papers that suggest GF plays a role
### Long term memory and corpus with implicit
### Musical Training 
### Aural Training 
## Musical Factors
### Not first to model structure
### Early papers of Ortmann
### Papers from 1980s 
### Buonviri Papers
### FANTASTIC papers and findings
## Modeling and Polymorphism of Ability (End Chapter)
### Draw from MMD ICMCP on problems with LV model 
### Thought experiments on why musicianship is bad concept in general
### Polymophic, component process makes you think about things in models
## Conclusions
### Clearly we have factors that are thought to contribute, need to investigate them in full with each chapter
### Not before first looking at why we are doing it in the first place (--transition to Chapter 2)
