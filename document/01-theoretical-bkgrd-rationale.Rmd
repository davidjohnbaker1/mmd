# Theoretical Background and Rationale {#intro}

## Significance of the Study (Why Important)

All students pursing a Bachelor's degree in Music from universities accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music must learn to take melodic dictation [@NASM201718HandbookPdf2018] VIII.6.B.2.A. 
This skill is a demanding process that requires students to listen to a melody, retain it in memory, and then use their knowledge of Western musical notation in order to recreate teh mental image of the melody on paper in a limited time frame.
Some researchers have estimated that XX amount of processes are needed to sucessfully execute this task FIND CITATION. 

## Order of Chapter 1

* Hook on why this is important
* What is melodic dictation?
  + Process (reasons of why factors)
  + Who has talked about it before?
  + Why is it important -- training ear and transfer
* Most of the people who are talking about this are pedagogical, really it's perceptual 
* Here is huge list of literature of things that might contribute
  + Pedagogical factors
  + Cognitive Factors
  + Musical Factors 
  + All of these are moving parts, need better tools to describe
* While this is the narrative, does not conform to updated view of polymorphism of musicianship

## Order of Chapter 2

* Most of this literature comes from pedagogy
* All quotes about people should be able to do this
* Long history of Aural Skills 
  + Older people
  + Current Methods
  + Their goals 
  + Their assumptions 

+ People are not good at this 
  + Wennerstronm (1989) said people at IU are not good at aural skills and sight singing p.163 (k7)
  + Julliard (1953,p. 48) incoming students have untrained ear (k7)
  
+ nice quote from chittum 1967 "the da is past when teachers can say, you either have it or you don't" (p.73)
+ Start of a big Journey back then, even more now (almost 2 decades since Karpinski, 2000)
 
 
### Theoretical Background

Lots of older studies looking at this listed on page 2 of Taylor and Pembrook 1983 (List here)

#### Computational Musicology 

#### Music Psychology and Memory for Melody

### Rationale 

#### Computational Musicology

#### Music Psychology 

### Factors

This section will list factors that are believed to be important to modeling melodic dictation.
Need to have both individual and musical parameters.
Ends with polymorphic view of musicianship.

  + Niels paper on Jazz similarity
  + My paper on Wagner

Pitch in Karpinki 

+ Pitch Matching (Work being done with Seatle, Pfordresher)
+ Pitch Memory (See Snyder)
+ Pitch Collection and Chunking 
+ Infereing Tonic
+ Melodic Contour 
+ Scale Degrees 
+ Identification of Intervals
+ Identifcaiton of Scale Types 
+ Solimization Systems

Melodic Dictation 

Kraft 1999 -- First part of book is for melodic dictation
Benward and Lolosick 1996a -- Melodic Dictation

Karpinski 1990 Has its own model for melodic perception?? 

Page 66 of K -- Relevant Melodic Contour Information 
page 68 of K -- Deutsch -- Familiar systems are better (now we have IDyOM)
Dowling and Harwood 1986 124-44 Melodic expectancy (probably better for Pearce)
READ Sloboda and Parker 1985

7-11 Notes? 
Marple ND reports that most things land in 7 +/-2, But not mention of IC! 
Found that if you make it rhythmic, goes up to 6-10, rhythm helps, but maybe it's just shorter time

Potter 1980 -- most people chunk (obvs question of segmentation)
Deutsch 1980 rhtym alines with pich, people do better than non-hierarchy 
Oura 1991 -- MODEL OF HOW MANY PITCHES PEOPLE REMEMBER, use for corpus question on pattern matching

Hofsetter 1981 -- people do better in bottom 4 time than 8 (again maybe confounded by IC)

Page 98 in Karpinksi has lenght and number of playings, 

Effect of tempo in  Unks, Bowers, and Eagle 1993

+++++++++++++++
Define the rationale and significance for this study
talk about what the processes are that go into this 
What are the implicit transfer claims of this? 
    + discussed in chapter 2 (history and rationale, Karpinski)
    + transfer literature also dicussed in chapter 2
Is there literature specifically on this? Yes, but scant.


what contributes to this whole process?

Note that there are two fields, both of which's literature can help out.
