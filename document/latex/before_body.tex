\chapter{Acknowledgements}

This dissertation would not have been possible without the support of a large community people over the past four years.
First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge and thank my dissertation committee.
Daniel Shanahan, my main supervisor throughout my doctoral work, who provided countless office conversations and cups of coffee at Highland-- but more importantly-- encouraged me to pursue my research interests at the intersection of music theory and music perception; Emily Elliott, for your unmatched support and guidance; and Robert Peck, for being living proof that research with music and numbers can always go together.

Secondly, I want to thank the entire Louisiana State University community for making me feel welcomed and supported.
The people make the place and everyone I met during my time in Baton Rouge existed as a constant source of knowledge and inspiration throughout my time as a student.
This includes the Music Cognition and Computation Lab at LSU, the weekly Tin Roof Trivia group, and professors like Jeffrey Perry and Jason Harman who opened the door for me every time I knocked.

Thirdly, I want to especially thank those who either went out of their way to help me learn the more technical aspects of research who often go unacknowledged.
Craig Sapp, for dealing with me as I learned about Humdrum, Yihui Xie for writing the bookdown software I used to write this dissertation, the \#rstats community, specifically Hadley Wickham, for making R so accessible, and Daniel Müllensiefen for starting me on my journey into programming.
Without a commitment to free and open source software, this research and dissertation would not have been possible.

Lastly, I want to thank all of my friends and family.
Thank you to Will, Rory, Kevin, Amanda, Ryan, Chris, Peter, Jono, Kris, Sarah, Phil (also for the melodies!), Owen, Jacob, Michael, Adam, Mark, Sasha, Lauryn, Connor, Elizabeth, Tanush, Tony, Andrew, Anthony, Savanna, Jared, Matt, Andrew, Erin, Lizbeth, Greg, my parents John and Mary, and especially Evelyn for all your support and love.
