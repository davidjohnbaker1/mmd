# Individual Differences

## Why care about cognitive abilities
### General intelligence and WMC 
### Defining of terms
## Have established that cognitive abilities contribute to musical task (for journal article langauge repeat)
### General Fluid Intelligence, WMC, Training as uni of polymorphic
## Remind the nature of a musical dictation type task (hear, loop, executive decision)  
### This is WMC task, gf has problems (Although high level link with gf, problematic, WMC models at level of process of md)
#### Berz 1994 noticed it first
#### Williamson Baddely Hitch suggest maybe musical loop
#### Even Cowan labs wonder how different (Li Cowan Saults )
## WMC has been misused in music education, theory, pedagogy, aural literature and deserves attention
### Problems with chunking 
#### Mistake with Miller 1956, he did not mean 7 items
#### Broadbent 1956 more of why its more like 3-4
### Problems with using capacity limit literature
#### See Cowan 2005 page 80
#### Musical order is always serial effects
### Should be using Cowan model because of these things (zooming) or discuss within Baddely Hitch/Atkinson Shriff
### One Note does not mean one unit in memory!
### Confounded by corpus distributions
### Lack of understanding (all aural skills are those that engage WMC, LVH says many students have WMC deficits, "increase memory")
### Point I am making is that if you're going to do it, do it well. 
## Know WMC plays a role, sense, pertain, execute, should be able to pick up in experiment close to MD
## Gold-MSI melodic Memory and beat perception test
### What is gold MSI 
### What are issues I want to talk about with psychometrics
### Describe test in detail and WHY it's what we're after here
#### not exactly mmd, but most people would say similar skill sets
#### also before getting dirty,need experimental desing with less response options (Cowan, Saults, Elliott, Moreano 2002)
## IF we accept these DVs, THEN we should be able to predict them with self reports and measures of WMC and gf
## Do this with hierarchical LVM ala Elliott paper 
### Versions of this paper at ICMPC
### Exploratory in that tried a few different models (high type I error but whatever)
## Overview of Experiment (cross sectional design)
### Participants
### Materials
### Procedure
### Results
#### Descriptive, Correlational
#### Modeling
### Discussion
#### Review of the Goals
#### What were best model fits
#### Clear effect of WMC
#### What if we are just measuring WMC? 
#### Obvs need this for futre studies
#### Need to use something to go above and beyond baseline (--transition to corpus as memory and n-gram)
#### Future verbal theoretical and computational models should involve capacity measures (limits)
