Ok thinking out loud here.

One of the claims that I want to make in the computational model is that there are lots of little n-grams and that the ease that people have in learning them initially shares a relationship between their frequency distributions in the corpus and how people hear them.

This in turn would be related to their information content. 

Things I would need to see this.

Import set of all melodies

SELECT what level of n-gram you want to break it into.

make a graph of all possible unique n-grams.

See that if you look at small sample of 2grams not distinct pattern
As you add in more melodies, becomes more pronounced.

Then swap to 3 grams, see same patterns.

See lumped distribution

Eventually you will get outside of the chunking range. 

-----

Can replace all the rhythms at start of melody with isorhythmic quarter notes
humdrum

comapre the average IC of the corpus with humdrum, FANTASTIC, IDyOM with Berkowitz
Talk about transition probabilities of berkowitz vs essen
What more does Berkowitz offer that essend does not? 
Chromatic and atonal expecations? 
How does that match with profiles generated by Krumhansl
