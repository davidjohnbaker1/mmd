Ok thinking out loud here.

One of the claims that I want to make in the computational model is that there are lots of little n-grams and that the ease that people have in learning them initially shares a relationship between their frequency distributions in the corpus and how people hear them.

This in turn would be related to their information content. 

Things I would need to see this.

Import set of all melodies

SELECT what level of n-gram you want to break it into.

make a graph of all possible unique n-grams.

See that if you look at small sample of 2grams not distinct pattern
As you add in more melodies, becomes more pronounced.

Then swap to 3 grams, see same patterns.

See lumped distribution

Eventually you will get outside of the chunking range.
